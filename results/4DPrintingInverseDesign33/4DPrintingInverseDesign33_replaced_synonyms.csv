We will share two end-to-end inverse design algorithms. With our tools, users can input CAD models of target surfaces and produce respective printable files. The flat sheet printed can morph into target surfaces when triggered by heat. This system saves shipping and packaging costs, in addition to enabling customizability for the design of relatively large non-developable structures. We designed a few functional artifacts to leverage the advantage of non-developable surfaces for their unique functionalities in aesthetics, mechanical strength, geometric ergonomics and other functionalities. In addition, we demonstrated how this technique can potentially be adapted to customize molds for industrial parts (e.g., car, boat, etc.) in the future. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Hence, improving flexibility and designability of the stimuli-responsive soft grippers for better grasping ability are highly desired. Inspired by the biological structure of octopuses, a class of temperature-driven polylactic acid grippers is fabricated by 4D printing in this work, which consists of two types of bilayer structures, separately imitating the web and tentacles of an octopus. Compared with the traditional pure-bending soft grippers, the integrated structure results in a 1.5 times wider reachable area and enhanced flexibility. The complex grasping behaviors are predicted with the 4D printing parameters (i.e., printing paths and printing speeds) using the reduced bilayer plate theory. Moreover, a method for determining the printing parameters of the gripper is provided to realize the desired grasping behavior depending on different objects. The feasibility of the design method is experimentally verified by gasping three distinctive objects, including an egg, a weight, and a Metatron's cube, which is in good agreement with the simulation results. Herein, a promising strategy is provided to achieve the easy-fabricated, low-cost, and versatile soft graspers using smart materials. © 2023 The Authors.

However, their design and fabrication remain challenging due to the difficulty of controlling the underlying metric tensor in space and time. Here, we exploit a combination of multiple materials, geometry, and 4-dimensional (4D) printing to create structured heterogeneous lattices that overcome this problem. Our printable inks are composed of elastomeric matrices with tunable cross-link density and anisotropic filler that enable precise control of their elastic modulus (E) and coefficient of thermal expansion (α). The inks are printed in the form of lattices with curved bilayer ribs whose geometry is individually programmed to achieve local control over the metric tensor. For independent control of extrinsic curvature, we created multiplexed bilayer ribs composed of 4 materials, which enables us to encode a wide range of 3-dimensional (3D) shape changes in response to temperature. As exemplars, we designed and printed planar lattices that morph into frequency-shifting antennae and a human face, demonstrating functionality and geometric complexity, respectively. Our inverse geometric design and multimaterial 4D printing method can be readily extended to other stimuli-responsive materials and different 2-dimensional (2D) and 3D cell designs to create scalable, reversible, shape-shifting structures with unprecedented complexity. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Programmable surfaces capable of altering their topology with a change in operational conditions have the potential to enable a wide range of applications in a variety of domains like haptics, wearables, human-computer interactions, fluid-surface interactions, and shape morphing structures. Prior research on programmable surfaces has developed various techniques to realize shape change applications. 4D printing includes multi-material printing of mechanisms that transform from any 1D or a 2D shape into a 3D shape using simple energy inputs like heat, water, or light. Additionally, origami composite structures with selective actuation of shape memory polymers also afford complex shape changes. We present a novel approach to designing programmable surfaces by incorporating shape memory alloys (SMA) and textile manufacturing processes to form variable topology programmable surfaces from knitted active textiles. Thermally responsive shape memory alloys (SMAs) leverage solid-state phase transformations and the shape memory effect to return the material to a predetermined state upon heating. The shape memory effect enables creation of multi-stiffness SMA configurations that can be utilized to develop structures with tunable surface topographies. Active knitted textiles act as programmable surfaces by transforming from an inactive 2D flat surface in the cold, flexible martensite state into active 3D surfaces when heated above the austenite finish transformation temperature. © 2021 SPIE.

The rapidly developing machine learning (ML) approach offers new opportunities and has attracted significant interest in the field. In this perspective paper, we highlight recent advancements in utilizing ML for designing printed structures with desired mechanical responses. First, we provide an overview of common forward and inverse problems, relevant types of structures, and design space and responses in 3D/4D printing. Second, we review recent works that have employed a variety of ML approaches for the inverse design of different mechanical responses, ranging from structural properties to active shape changes. Finally, we briefly discuss the main challenges, summarize existing and potential ML approaches, and extend the discussion to broader design problems in the field of 3D/4D printing.

However, 4D printings are generally studied with soft materials which are easy to deform. Ceramics are intrinsically hard and brittle which hinders their development in 4D printing. In this study, through utilizing stress mismatch of printed ceramic in sintering, 4D printing of ceramic structures is realized. Generally, shrinkage of a 3D printed ceramic body after sintering is in inverse proportion to the solid content of ceramic ink used. By printing bilayer zirconia (ZrO2) ceramic with high solid content in the bottom layer and low solid content in the top layer, the shrinkage mismatch after sintering results in shape-changing from a flat plane to a curved structure. We also find that we can tailor the shape-morphing behaviors of ceramic structures by routing the printing process. Finally, through programming the solid content of ceramic inks and printing paths, 4D-printed ceramic flowers with various characteristics are achieved. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",4d printing technology; ceramics; shape-morphing; shrinkage mismatch; sinter,shrinking; zirconium_oxide; 3d printing; 3d printing; 4d printing technology; ceramic; ceramic inks; ceramics structure; complex shapes; shape morphing structures; shrinkage mismatch; solids content; sinter,"P.

Westmeath, N37 HD68, Ireland","The design and manufacturing of objects in various industries have been fundamentally altered by the introduction of D-dimensional (3D) and four-dimensional (4D) printing technologies. Four-dimensional printing, a relatively new technique, has emerged as a result of the ongoing development and advancements in 3D printing. In this study, a stimulus-responsive material, N-Vinylcaprolactam-co-DEGDA (NVCL-co-DEGDA) resin, was synthesised by Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing technique. The N-Vinylcaprolactam-co-DEGDA resins were initiated by the Diphenyl (2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl) phosphine oxide (TPO) photoinitiator. A range of Di(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (DEGDA) concentrations in the NVCL-co-DEGDA resin was explored, ranging from 5 wt% to 40 wt%. The structural properties of the 3D printed objects were investigated by conducting Attenuated Total Reflectance–Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR). Additionally, the 3D printed samples underwent further characterisation through differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and swelling analysis. The results revealed an inverse relationship between DEGDA concentration and Tg values, indicating that higher concentrations of DEGDA resulted in lower Tg values. Additionally, the pulsatile swelling studies demonstrated that increasing DEGDA concentration prolonged the time required to reach the maximum swelling ratio. These findings highlight the influence of DEGDA concentration on both the thermal properties and swelling behaviour of 3D printed samples. © 2024 by the authors.",3d printing; 4d printing technology; n-vinylcaprolactam; shape memory polymers; stereolithography,,"E.

Accordingly, four-dimensional (4D) printing is a manufacturing process that involves multiple research fields. 4D printing conserves the general attributes of 3D printing (such as material waste reduction, and elimination of molds, dies, and machining) and further enables the fourth dimension of products to provide intelligent behavior over time. This intelligent behavior is encoded (usually by an inverse mathematical problem) into stimuli-responsive multi-materials during printing, and is enabled by stimuli after printing. The main difference between 3D- and 4D-printed structures is the presence of one additional dimension, which provides for smart evolution over time. However, currently there is no general formula for modeling and predicting this additional dimension. Herein, by starting from fundamentals, we derive and validate a general bi-exponential formula with a particular format that can model the time-dependent behavior of nearly all 4D (hydro-, photochemical-, photothermal-, solvent-, pH-, moisture-, electrochemical-, electrothermal-, ultrasound-, etc. responsive) structures. We show that two types of time constants are needed to capture the correct time-dependent behavior of 4D multi-materials. We introduce the concept of mismatch-driven stress at the interface of active and passive materials in 4D multi-material structures, leading to one of the two time constants. We develop and extract the other time constant from our unified model of time-dependent behavior of nearly all stimuli-responsive materials. Our results starting from the most fundamental concepts and ending with governing equations can serve as general design principles for future research in the field of 4D printing, where time-dependent behaviors should be properly understood, modeled, and predicted. © 2020 Chinese Academy of Engineering",4d printing technology; fabrication; mechanics of materials; stimuli-responsive materials; time constant,industrial research; inverse problems; additive manufacturing process; fundamental concepts; manufacturing process; mathematical problems; multi-material structures; stimuli-responsive materials; three-dimensional (3d) printing; time dependent behavior; 3d printers,"F.

In the present investigation, novel 4D thermoinks composed of laponite (LAP), an interpenetrating network of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm), and alginate (ALG) are developed for direct printing of shape-morphing structures. This approach consists of the design and fabrication of 3D honeycomb-patterned hydrogel discs self-rolling into tubular constructs under the stimulus of temperature. The shape morphing behavior of hydrogels is due to shear-induced anisotropy generated via 3D printing. The compositionally tunable hydrogel discs can be programmed to exhibit different actuation behaviors at different temperatures. Upon immersion in 12 °C water, singly crosslinked sheets roll up into a tubular construct. When transferred to 42 °C water, the tubes first rapidly unfold and then slightly curve up in the opposite direction. Through a dual photocrosslinking of PNIPAAm, it is possible to inverse temperature-dependent shape morphing and induce self-folding at higher and unrolling at lower temperatures. The extensive self-assembling motion is essential to developing thermal actuators with broad applications in, e.g., soft robotics and active implantology, whereas controllable self-rolling of planar hydrogels is of the highest interest to biomedical engineering as it allows for effective fabrication of hollow tubes. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH",4d printing technology; actuator; hydrogel; self-assembly; stimuli-responsive materials,acrylic monomers; actuator disks; amide; biomedical engineering; hydrogel; robot programming; thermal engineering; hydrogel actuators; inverse temperatures; lower temperatures; photocross-linking; poly-n-isopropyl acrylamide; shape morphing structures; shear-induced anisotropy; temperature-induced; 3d printers,"D.

Moreover, using supporting material tends to rough the printed surfaces, and removing it can damage the printed parts. By contrast, 4D printing can create 3D surfaces without needing supporting material. By integrating active material into the 3D printing, 4D printing allows the printed structure to re-deform through external stimuli, such as heating. Because of this characteristic, 4D printing can achieve shape-morphing from the designed 2D grid into the target 3D gridshell. In this work, we utilize multimaterial 4D printing technology to fabricate face-like masks. We first print a 2D grid consisting of rectangular arranged double-layered segments; each segment has four different material combinations, in which each layer is made of either shape memory polymer (SMP55) or PLA. Based on those different material combinations, 4D printing can generate corresponding deformation modes as SMP55 shrinks by heating to release the residual stress stored during 3D printing. Lastly, a highly complex human-face mask gridshell can be achieved by controlling the deformed grid's global and local curvature through the material combination of each segment and their distribution. The inverse design from the target 3D gridshell to the initial 2D grid is challenging due to the high nonlinearity of the deformation mechanism. To solve this problem, we use a deep learning model: fully convolutional networks (FCNs) to automate the inverse design process. This study uses human-face and Noh (a traditional Japanese art) masks as examples. First, we divide the human-face mask 2D grids into several parameters to generate random 2D human-face mask grid designs, which can be converted to corresponding depth images as 60,000 datasets after simulating their heat deformation processes by finite element method (FEM). Next, the depth images are used for training the FCN model that executes image segmentation tasks for inverse design, and then we can use Noh mask depth images to verify the validity of trained FCN models. Finally, although the average similarity of human-face masks between using 4D printing and the target is 0.9, the trained FCN model does not perform well for Noh masks since human-face masks' parameters cannot describe Noh masks adequately. In conclusion, our 4D printing technology successfully demonstrates the feasibility and potential to generate complex 3D curved structures.

The proposed method reduces upper limb tremors, taking advantage of the nonlinear mechanical properties of flexible structures. The model's development and execution on a single platform streamlines integrated inverse design and simulation, simplifying the customization process. A synthetic human arm model, built to imitate a human wrist, was scanned with a light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensor to customize the 3D model of the bistable structure. Afterwards, the arm model was used to test the bistable mechanism. Automating the inverse design process with a deep neural network (DNN) and evolutionary optimization decides the optimal bistable mechanism configurations for stiffness and vibration attenuation. The pseudo-rigid-body model (PRBM) of the bistable mechanism was developed to train the machine learning (ML) model in the inverse design, making it computationally affordable to find the optimal parameters of bistable structure for a specific mechanical response based on tremor characteristics.

However, structural shape-transformation usually consists of a series of bending behaviors in response to external stimuli, which require complex aggregation and multi-materials design. To overcome these complexities, this work explores an alternative approach using only a single hydrogel-based material to realize such bending mechanisms. Numerical simulations are first implemented to realize bending deformation by spatially assigning distinct material parameters to different sections of the structure. The bending phenomenon is also shown experimentally using hydrogel-based biomaterial inks. Specifically, a deformable structure is fabricated by finely controlling different post-processing conditions such as cooling time, crosslinking duration, and heating rate during swelling to mimic the effect of different material parameters. Moreover, the bending deformation can be further analyzed using computer vision methods to inversely determine the desired material coefficients in the simulation. Relationships among bending mechanisms, material parameters, and post-processing procedures are found and shown to affect the final bending orientation. These results yield insightful approaches to the inverse design of functional biomedical devices with desired deformation behavior. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.",4d-bioprinting; deformable structures; hydrogel; post-processing conditions,biomaterial; hydrogel; ink; polymer; solvent; article; biocompatibility; biomechanics; bioprinting; computer aided design; computer simulation; computer vision; cooling; cross linking; drug delivery system; heat_content; environment; excipient compatibility; finite element analysis; four-dimensional imaging; heating; homo; mathematical model; model; porosity; retina fovea; sensitivity analysis; simulation; swelling; temperature; tensile strength; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; speed; visual field; water transport; young modulus,"G.X.

However, implementing these materials can pose significant challenges. In this study, stair-stepping mechanical metamaterials with programmable load plateaus are presented, which are created via a three-level (unit, module, and 3D object) construction strategy. The strategy inspired by the inverse design concept achieves tunability in the number and properties of load plateaus within the force–displacement profiles of the metamaterials. This approach even yields appealing stair-stepping response patterns, as validated by experiments and finite element simulations. Promisingly, programming the unit from its initial configuration to a “zero stiffness” configuration enables these metamaterials excellent vibration isolation performance. Furthermore, two reversible methods are proposed for switching among various unit configurations, namely shape memory programming and supporting payload. This innovative design strategy for programmable load plateaus opens up new possibilities for creating metamaterials with customized force–displacement responses. It also provides opportunities to incorporate multimodal vibration isolation capabilities into precision devices. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",4d printing technology; load plateaus; shape memory polymers; stair-stepping mechanical metamaterials; vibration isolations,inverse problems; loads (forces); stairs; vibrations (mechanical); 4d printing technology; isolation systems; load plateaus; mechanical; shape memory polymers; stair-stepping mechanical metamaterials; suppression systems; target load; vibration isolations; vibration suppression; metamaterials,"Y.

Voxel-level complex material distributions offer a vast possibility for attainable shape changes of 4D-printed ACs, while also posing a significant challenge in efficiently designing material distributions to achieve target shape changes. Here, we present an integrated machine learning (ML) and sequential subdomain optimization (SSO) approach for ultrafast inverse designs of 4D-printed AC structures. By leveraging the inherent sequential dependency, a recurrent neural network ML model and SSO are seamlessly integrated. For multiple target shapes of various complexities, ML-SSO demonstrates superior performance in optimization accuracy and speed, delivering results within second(s). When integrated with computer vision, ML-SSO also enables an ultrafast, streamlined design-fabrication paradigm based on hand-drawn targets. Furthermore, ML-SSO empowered with a splicing strategy is capable of designing diverse lengthwise voxel configurations, thus showing exceptional adaptability to intricate target shapes with different lengths without compromising high speed and accuracy. As a comparison, for the benchmark three-period shape, the finite element and evolutionary algorithm (EA) method was estimated to need 219 days for the inverse design; the ML-EA achieved the design in 54 min; the new ML-SSO with splicing strategy requires only 1.97 s. By further leveraging appropriate symmetries, the highly efficient ML-SSO is employed to design active shape changes of 4D-printed lattice structures. The new ML-SSO approach thus provides a highly efficient tool for the design of various 4D-printed, shape-morphing AC structures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",4d printing technology; active composites; inverse designs; machine learning approaches; morphing structures,recurrent neural networks; shape optimization; 4d printing technology; active composites; composites structures; inverse designs; machine-learning; morphing structures; shape change; sub-domain optimization; target shape; ultra-fast; inverse problems,"H.J.

However, addressing these needs would require improved control over local properties using in-line feedback from fast-acting low-fidelity models during the fabrication process. In this regard, differential evaporation is an inherent characteristic in metal AM processes, directly influencing local chemistry, material properties, functionality, and performance. In the present work, a differential evaporation model (DEM) is presented for laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) AM to predict and control the effect of evaporation on chemistry and properties on local and part-wide scales. The DEM model is coupled with an analytical thermal model that is calibrated against 51.2 Ni [at%] nickel titanium shape memory alloy (NiTi SMA) single-track experiments and a multi-layer model that accounts for the AM part's multi-layer design and the inherent melt pool overlap and chemistry propagation. The combined hierarchical model, consisting of the thermal, evaporation, and multi-layer components, is used to predict location-specific chemistry for LBPF AM fabrication of Ni50.8Ti49.2 [at%] SMAs. Model predictions are validated with values obtained from multi-layer experiments on a commercial LPBF system, resulting in a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.25 Ni [at%] for predicted Ni content. Additionally, martensitic transformation temperature, Ms, is calculated and compared with empirical data, resulting in an RMSE of 18.6 K. A practical account of the cumulative and propagative thermal-induced evaporation effect on location-specific chemistry is made through this linkage of models. Fundamentally, this model chain has also provided a solution to the forward modeling problem, enabling steps to be taken towards resolving the inverse design problem of determining processing parameters based on desired location-specific properties. © 2021 The Authors",4d printing technology; additive manufacturing process; bayesian calibration; differential evaporation; markov chain monte carlo; niti; shape memory alloys(sma),3d printers; additive; binary alloys; vaporization; prediction; hierarchical systems; inverse problems; location; martensitic transformations; mean square error; metadata; nickel alloys; 4d printing technology; bayesian calibration; differential evaporation; evaporation model; laser powders; markov chain monte carlo; markov chain monte-carlo; multi-layers; powder bed; root mean square errors; titanium alloys,"M.

Direct 4D printing is a compelling method to morph complex 3D shapes out of as-printed 2D plates. However, most direct 4D printing methods require multi-material systems involving costly machines. Moreover, most works have used an open-cell design for shape shifting by encoding a collection of 1D rib deformations, which cannot remain structurally stable. Here, we demonstrate the direct 4D printing of an isotropic single-material system to morph 2D continuous bilayer plates into doubly curved and multimodal 3D complex shapes whose geometry can also be locked after deployment. We develop an inverse-design algorithm that integrates extrusion-based 3D printing of a single-material system to directly morph a raw printed sheet into complex 3D geometries such as a doubly curved surface with shape locking. Furthermore, our inverse-design tool encodes the localized shape-memory anisotropy during the process, providing the processing conditions for a target 3D morphed geometry. Our approach could be used for conventional extrusion-based 3D printing for various applications including biomedical devices, deployable structures, smart textiles, and pop-up Kirigami structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",direct 4d printing; doubly curved surfaces; inverse designs; self-actuation,3d printers; encoding (symbols); geometry; inverse problems; plates (structural components); signal encoding; 3d printing; complex 3d shapes; curved surfaces; direct 4d printing; doubly curved surfaces; inverse designs; isotropics; material systems; multi-modal; self actuation; bulge,"J.

Integrating active composites and 4D printing allows the printed structure to have a pre-designed complex material or property distribution on numerous small voxels, offering enormous design flexibility. However, this tremendous design space also poses a challenge in efficiently finding appropriate designs to achieve a target shape change. Here, a novel machine learning (ML) and evolutionary algorithm (EA) based approach is presented to guide the design process. Inspired by the beam deformation characteristics, a recurrent neural network (RNN) based ML model whose training dataset is acquired by finite element simulations is developed for the forward shape-change prediction. EA empowered with ML is then used to solve the inverse problem of finding the optimal design. For multiple target shapes with different complexities, the ML-EA approach demonstrates high efficiency. Combining the ML-EA with computer vision algorithms, a new paradigm is presented that streamlines design and 4D printing process where active straight beams can be designed based on hand-drawn lines and be 4D printed that transform into the drawn profiles under the stimulus.

While many flattening algorithmshave been introduced for 4D printing, a general method customized for FDM (Fused-Deposition Modeling) printing method is lacking. In this work, we vary both the printing direction and local layer thickness; and extend the shape space to continuous-height-field surfaces without the requirement of symmetry. We introduce an end-to-end tool that enables an initially flat sheet to self-transform into the input height field. The tool first flattens the height field into a 2D layout with stress information using a geometry-based optimization algorithm, then computes printing tool paths with a path planning algorithm. Although FDM printing is the fabrication method in this work, our approach can be applied to most extrusion-based printing methods in theory. The results exemplify how the tool broadens the capabilities of 4D printing with an expanded shape space, a low-cost but precise coloring technique, and an intuitive design process.  © 2020 Owner/Author.",3d printing; 4d printing technology; computational fabrication; computer-aided design; geometry optimization; inverse designs; shape-changing interface,computation theory; fabrication; fused deposition modeling; inverse problems; texture; design process; fabrication method; inverse designs; layer thickness; optimization algorithms; path-planning algorithm; printing method; printing process; design,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097649891

The development of multifunctional structures and their desired mechanical/actuation performances require tackling 4D printing from a multi-material design perspective. With the materials distributions there is an opportunity to increase the spectrum of design concepts with computational approaches. The main goal being to achieve the “best” distribution of material properties in a voxelized structure, a computational framework that consists of a finite element analysis-based evolutionary algorithm is presented. It fuses the advantages of optimizing both the materials distribution and material layout within a design space via topology optimization to solve the inverse design problem of finding an optimal design to achieve a target shape change by integrating void voxels. The results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in providing a highly capable tool for the design of 4D-printed active composites. © 2023, The Author(s).",,inverse problems; shape optimization; active composites; computational design and fabrication; energy; material distribution; mechanical actuations; multi materials; multi-material designs; multifunctional structures; performance; spatial arrangements; topology,"F.

The research on self-bending deformation of 4D printing structure is mainly based on experiments, and the 4D printing product design is guided by a large number of experiments. In order to solve this problem, a layout design method of incentive source for self-bending of 4D printing double-layer structure is proposed. Simple double-layer structure is used as the incentive source of complex structure deformation. The deformation results of 4D printing structure driven by multiple incentive sources can be simulated theoretically and the self-bending simulation of 4D printing structure can be realized only by testing the excitation source. At the same time, the idea of inverse calculation of layout parameters of incentive source are also put forward, which effectively solves the design problem of 4D printing self-bending structure product, and provides a new idea for the design of 4D printing structure. Finally, the effectiveness of the method is verified by experiments. It is found that the number of excitation sources has a greater impact on the bending of the structure than the spacing of excitation sources. The self-bending deformation of 4D printing double-layer structure can be controlled by reasonable design of the number and interval of excitation sources. © 2020 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.",4d printing technology; incentive source; mindlin theory; self-bending,bending (deformation); inverse problems; product design; bending structures; complex structure; deformation result; design problems; double layer structure; excitation sources; inverse calculation; layout designs; structural design,"G.

It is based on 3D printing technology, but requires additional stimulus and stimulus-responsive materials. Based on certain interaction mechanisms between the stimulus and smart materials, as well as appropriate design of multi-material structures from mathematical modeling, 4D printed structures evolve as a function of time and exhibit intelligent behavior. Unlike 3D printing, 4D printing is time-dependent, printer-independent, predictable, and targets shape/property/functionality evolution. This allows for self-assembly, multi-functionality, and self-repair. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the 4D printing process and summarizes the practical concepts and related tools that have a prominent role in this field. Unsought aspects of 4D printing are also studied and organized for future research. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",4d printing technology; digital materials; inverse and forward problems; multi-material structures; shape-shifting mechanisms; voxel,3d printers; function; inverse problems; printing presses; self assembly; d-printing; digital materials; forward problem; multi-material structures; shape-shifting mechanisms; voxel; printing,"X.

However, the tremendous design space of multiple materials brings the challenges of finding the optimum material distributions accurately, and the consistencies between simulated optimum results and actual experimental structures. Therefore, the controllable deformation design framework is proposed to guide the inverse design of 4D-printed active composite structure. The material properties of polylactic acid (PLA) and thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) are tested and integrated into forward deformation analysis to improve the prediction accuracy of finite element analysis (FEA). An optimization integration framework with genetic algorithm is developed to optimize the material distribution and external displacement simultaneously to achieve the target deformation. Several voxelized beams and flower structures are used as engineering cases. The simulated and experimental deformation shapes and recovery shapes for the optimum structures are consistent with the target deformations. The mean squared errors (MSEs) of experimental shape and simulation shape are 0.62 mm and 0.27 mm for flower structures. These results show that the proposed methodology can obtain target deformation in simulation and experimental tests simultaneously, which can be applied into the flexible deformation design of complex active composite structures in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",4d printing technology; active composite structures; material distribution; optimization design,composite structures; inverse problems; mean square error; shape optimization; structural optimization; structure (composition); 4d printing technology; active composite structures; active composites; composite structure optimization; composites structures; controllable deformations; flower structures; material distribution; optimization design; optimization-simulation; genetic algorithms,"X.

However, the high degree of design freedom and the microscale pose a challenge to the construction of micromachines with customized shape morphing. Here, a reverse design strategy based on multi-material stepwise 4D printing is proposed to guide the structural design of biomimetic micromachines. Inspired by the piecewise constant curvature model of soft robot, a reverse design algorithm based on the Timoshenko model is developed. The algorithm can approximate 2D features to a constant-curvature model and determine an acceptable material distribution within the explored printing range. Three Chinese “Long” (Chinese dragon heralds of good fortune) designed by the strategy can deform to the customized shape. In addition, a microcrawler printed using this method can imitate a real inchworm gait.

One key advantage of active composites is that through mechanics design, a variety of actuation can be achieved. The development of active composites has been significantly enhanced in recent years by multimaterial 3D printing where different materials can be precisely placed in 3D space, enabling the achievement of shape-shifting of 3D printed parts, or 4D printing. In practical applications, it is highly desirable that the part shape can change in a pre-described manner, which requires the careful design of where to place different materials. However, designing an active composite structure to achieve a target shape change is challenging because it requires solving an inverse problem with spatially heterogenous, highly nonlinear (active) material behavior within a potentially complex boundary value problem. In this paper we present a machine learning approach to the design of active composite structures that can achieve target shape shifting responses. Our strategy is to combine the finite element method with an evolutionary algorithm. In order to achieve a target shape, we compose the structures of equally sized voxel units that are made of either a passive or an active material and optimize the distribution of these two material phases. The optimization method is tested against several illustrative examples in active composite design to show the agreement between the target shape and the best machine learning solution obtained. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.",3d printing; 4d printing technology; active composite structures; design; evolutional algorithm; machine learning approaches,3d printers; boundary value problems; design; electron emission; evolutionary algorithms; inverse problems; learning systems; machine learning approaches; structure (composition); 3d printing; active composites; active material; d-printing; evolutional algorithm; machine learning approaches; material behavior; optimization method; structural design,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068449083

Specifically, we target a class of structures consisting of a quadrangular grid with all rods interconnected to create a periodically corrugated shape, which offers surface programmability and resilience of the structure. The shape of such a structure is the result of a complex nonlinear equilibrium. We bypass the costly inverse computation of such equilibrium by decomposing the computation of macroscopic shrinkage behavior solved geometrically and microscopic material behavior modeled through experiments. We first investigate the behavior of programmable textiles through experiments, subsequently construct a geometric model to represent the deformation, and then propose a three-step inverse design method. The design method first calculates a conformal mapping of the target shape onto a planar region. Then, we determine an optimized grid layout for arranging rods satisfying geometric constraints on this planar region. Finally, the cross-sectional shapes of the rods at each part are computed based on experimental results. Thanks to our geometric model, there are smaller geometric constraints than the number of variables for determining the grid layouts. This design flexibility allows the grid layout to incorporate smooth boundary conditions and user preferences on the grid shapes.

This integration introduces challenges in designing printable, responsive materials and structures. Current research focuses on improving the responsiveness and mechanical performance of smart materials, but incremental advances often lack sufficient feedback for achieving specific properties, shapes, and performance targets. Inverse design has emerged as a strategy for determining material compositions and structural configurations to meet desired outputs, but its application remains limited to simple structures. Accelerating material and structural discovery is crucial for advancing 4D printing. Artificial intelligence (AI), especially machine learning (ML), offers promising solutions to address the complexity of 4D printing design. However, conventional AI approaches often lack logical reasoning, explainability, and interpretability. This review paper highlights recent achievements and challenges in 4D printing design and introduces neuro-symbolic AI as a promising approach. By combining ML's learning capabilities with the logical reasoning and semantic understanding of symbolic AI, this approach can enhance the exploration of advanced active materials and structures. The insights provided aim to guide future research toward optimizing 4D printing for broader applications and enhanced performance. © 2025 The Author(s)",4d printing technology; additive manufacturing process; inverse designs; machine learning approaches; neural networks and genetic algorithms; neuro-symbolic ai; symbolic ai,additive; contrastive learning; inverse problems; 4d printing technology; accelerated design; adaptive devices; inverse designs; logical reasoning; machine-learning; neural-networks; neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence; printing designs; symbolic artificial intelligence; smart manufacturing,"F.

Voxel-level complex material distributions can be encoded by 3D printing, offering enormous freedom for possible shape-change 4D-printed ACs. However, efficiently designing the material distribution to achieve desired 3D shape changes is significantly challenging yet greatly needed. Here, we present an approach that combines machine learning (ML) with both gradient-descent (GD) and evolutionary algorithm (EA) to design AC plates with 3D shape changes. A residual network ML model is developed for the forward shape prediction. A global-subdomain design strategy with ML-GD and ML-EA is then used for the inverse material-distribution design. For a variety of numerically generated target shapes, both ML-GD and ML-EA demonstrate high efficiency. By further combining ML-EA with a normal distance-based loss function, optimized designs are achieved for multiple irregular target shapes. Our approach thus provides a highly efficient tool for the design of 4D-printed active composites. © The Author(s) 2024.",,algorithm; design; machine learning approaches; prediction; spatial distribution; article; drug development; evolutionary algorithms; machine learning approaches; prediction; three dimensional printing,"H.J.

This process can be used to create objects with heavily curved geometries by first printing them flat, then subsequently warping them to a desired final shape. Most work in 4D printing involves flat, single-layer, effectively two dimensional initial printed configurations, which limits the print's ability to warp and curve in both directions. As a step to address these limitations, we propose a novel modeling and simulation framework for 4D printed, multi-tiered grids. These grids consist of multi-layered, interconnected nodes that differentially shrink at each layer in order to create curvatures in either direction. These nodes can all be assigned curvature and size values independently, giving grids the ability to create complex surfaces. Bezier patches and triangle mesh models can be used as targets to generate grids that closely mimic the geometry of the input surface after stimulation. Under forward simulation, nodes within grids are able to recreate distances and curvatures measured on target surfaces within approximately 1% tolerance, and full grids closely resemble their desired shapes. © 2023 CAD Solutions, LLC.",4d printing technology; fdm; inverse designs; optimization; simulation,3d printers; inverse problems; 3d printing; 3d printing; 4d printing technology; design and simulation; inverse designs; multi-tiered; optimization; simulation; single layer; warp; frequency division multiplexing,"J.

This gap arises from the difficulty of handling varying input sizes in machine learning paradigms. To address this, we propose a novel machine learning-driven approach for forward prediction and inverse design tailored to 4D printed hierarchical architectures with arbitrary shapes. Our method encodes non-rectangular shapes with special identifiers, transforming the design domain into a format suitable for machine learning analysis. Using Residual Networks (ResNet) for forward prediction and evolutionary algorithms (EA) for inverse design, our approach achieves accurate and efficient predictions and designs. The results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, with the forward prediction model achieving a loss below 10−2mm, and the inverse optimization model maintaining an error near 1 mm, which is low relative to the entire shape of the optimized model. These outcomes demonstrate the capability of our approach to accurately predict and design complex hierarchical structures in 4D printing applications. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",4d printing technology; design optimization; evolutionary algorithms; hierarchical architectures; inverse designs; machine learning approaches; residual network,prediction; inverse problems; learning algorithms; machine learning approaches; network architecture; 4d printing technology; arbitrary shape; design optimization; forward prediction; hierarchical architectures; inverse designs; machine-learning; rectangular plates; rectangular surfaces; residual network; evolutionary algorithms,"Q.
