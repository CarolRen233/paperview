LFAM facilitates the layer-by-layer production of sizeable industrial components in carbon fiber (CF) reinforced polymers, however 3D printing at large scales results in warpage generation. Printed components are deformed as residual stresses generated due to thermal gradients between adjacent layers. This paper tackles the problem at two different scales: the micro and macroscale. Initially, the microstructure characterization of the thermoplastic ABS matrix composite material enriched with 20% short CF is used in the development of numerical models to understand the mechanical behavior of the studied material. Numerical modeling is performed simultaneously by means of Mean-Field (MF) homogenization methods and Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Outcomes validated with corrected experimental mechanical testing results show a discrepancy in the elastic modulus of 7.8% with respect to FE multi-layer analysis. Micro-level results are coupled with the a macroscopic approach to reproduce the LFAM process, demonstrating the feasibility of the tool in the development of a Digital Twin (DT). © 2024, The Author(s).","Digital twin; Fused granulated fabrication; Large format additive manufacturing; Mean-field homogenization","Additives; Automotive industry; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Homogenization method; Mechanical testing; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Polymer matrix composites; Additive manufacturing process; Aerospace and automotive industries; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Fused granulated fabrication; Industrial components; Large format additive manufacturing; Large-format; Layer by layer; Mean-field homogenizations; Topology optimisation; 3D printing","P.

In this study, a novel fiber strain sensor was proposed with micro-nano topology optimization, which was achieved through a simple, cost-effective and scalable method. A TPU/PEO substrate was prepared by electrospinning technology, then the fibrous membrane was immersed in deionized water to wash away the PEO and obtain the micro-nano topological structure. Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene were further adsorbed on the etched TPU fibrous membrane through ultrasonic treatment to obtain TPU:PEO/CNTs and TPU:PEO/graphene sensors, respectively. Both experimental and simulation results showed that the optimization of the PEO ratio is crucial for the balance between wide deformation and high sensitivity. A wide detection range (0-650%) and high sensitivity (GFmax = 976.89) were obtained for the TPU:PEO/graphene sensor, demonstrating its suitability for high-performance strain sensors. It can not only capture minor human movements, but also be effectively applied in fitness scenarios, which may contribute to personalized scientific training and reduce sports injuries. © 2024 RSC.","","Fibrous membranes; Shape optimization; Wearable sensors; Cost-effective methods; Fiber strain sensors; Flexible sensor; Graphenes; High sensitivity; Micro/nano; Scalable methods; Simple++; Strain sensors; Topology optimisation; Deionized water","Z.

The introduction of heterocycles in polymer chains increases their flexibility and makes it easier to optimize the fiber structure. However, the inadequate orientation of polymer chains is one of the main reasons for the large difference between the measured and theoretical mechanical properties of PBIA fibers. Herein, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are selected as an orientation seed. Their structural features allow CNTs to orient during the spinning process, which can induce an orderly arrangement of polymers and improve the orientation of the fiber microstructure. To ensure the complete 1D topology of long CNTs (≈10 µm), PBIA is used as an efficient dispersant to overcome dispersion challenges. The p-CNT/PBIA fibers (10 µm single-walled carbon nanotube 0.025 wt%) exhibit an increase of 22% in tensile strength and 23% in elongation, with a maximum tensile strength of 7.01 ± 0.31 GPa and a reinforcement efficiency of 893.6. The artificial muscle fabricated using CNT/PBIA fibers exhibits a 34.8% contraction and a 25% lifting of a 2 kg dumbbell, providing a promising paradigm for high-performance organic fibers as high-load smart actuators. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","1D topology; artificial muscles; carbon nanotubes; damage-free dispersion; heterocyclic aramid fibers; mechanical properties; orientation seed","Muscle; Organic compounds; Spinning (fibers); Tensile strength; Topology; 1d topology; Artificial muscle; Benzimidazoles; Damage-free; Damage-free dispersion; Heterocyclic aramid fiber; Orientation seed; P-phenylene; Polymer chains; Terephthalamides; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN)","J.

Firstly, optimal configurations of the resin material and fiber reinforcement are obtained to maximize the structural stiffness under desired volume constraints using the two-material topological optimization. After that, the level set-based cutting mesh method and triangulation scheme are employed to interpret these topological designs into stereolithography (STL) models with clear structural boundaries for the manufacturing. A customized pre-processing strategy is used to accurately determine the fiber placement regions from the optimal designs. Topological results are then fabricated using the CCF-based 3D printing method with prepreg carbon fibers. Subsequently, the performance of printed CCF-reinforced composite structures is investigated, using different resin materials: polylactic acid (PLA) and polyamide 12 with 10% carbon fiber (PA12_10CF). Experimental results indicate a significant increase in stiffness and strength of composite structures with fiber reinforcements for all resin materials, with an increase of 315% for PLA and 234% for PA12_10CF. Additionally, the CCF-reinforced composite structures made of PA12_10CF exhibit superior stiffness compared to those made of PLA with a double increment. The microstructural characteristics of damaged regions are examined using scanning electron microscope (SEM) images, which provide valuable insights into the behavior of resin and fiber materials. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Additive manufacturing; Composite structures; Continuous carbon fiber; Experimental validation; Two-material topology optimization","Additives; Fabrication; Fibers; Numerical methods; Reinforcement; Resins; Scanning electron microscopy; Shape optimization; Stiffness; Structure (composition); Topology; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Composites structures; Continuous carbon fiber; Experimental validations; Fibre reinforced composite structures; Poly-amide 12; Resin materials; Topology optimisation; Two-material topology optimization; Two-materials; 3D printing","T.-D.

The Tsai–Wu failure criterion is also developed based on the experimental data. The tensile–compressive behavior models of different orthotropic materials were constructed by importing the experimental data into COMSOL, followed by a compression simulation of the S-shaped specimen. The experimental results of the S-shaped compression test were compared with the COMSOL-based simulation analysis, which validated the effectiveness of the Tsai–Wu failure prediction. The predicted failure timings, locations and load–displacement curves all show a good agreement with experimental observations.

This work investigates the structural performances of 3D printing composite filaments based on polylactic acid (PLA), as a matrix, reinforced by recycled carbon fiber (rCF). Carbon fibers were recovered from industrial scraps by a patented thermal process and used to produce thermoplastic composite filaments for additive manufacturing without any additional treatment and additives. The influence of the recovered carbon fiber (rCF) content on the thermal properties, mechanical properties and microstructure of the composites was studied in the range of 3–20 wt%. The recorded TGA curves exhibited a one-stage weight loss within the temperature range 290–380 °C for all samples and the residual rCF content was in good agreement with the theoretical fiber loading. The Young modulus of the extruded filaments strongly increased below a critical content (5 wt%), while at higher content the improvement was reduced. An increase in the storage modulus of 54% compared to neat PLA 3D printed sample resulted in a printed specimen with a higher rCF content. SEM images highlighted a strong rCF prevailing alignment in the direction of the extrusion flow, creating almost unidirectional reinforcement inside the filament. These findings suggest that homogeneous composite filaments reinforced with well-dispersed recycled CF without additional chemical modification and additives are suitable materials for additive manufacturing. The effect of rCF topological distribution within the material on the mechanical performances has been discussed, highlighting that the isolated fibers could efficiently transfer loads with respect to the percolated 3D network and have been correlated with the microstructure. © 2024 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; composites; FFF; mechanical properties; polylactic acid; recovered carbon fiber","Additives; Carbon fibers; Chemical modification; Microstructure; Polyesters; Recycling; Reinforced plastics; Scrap metal reprocessing; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; FFF; Fibers content; Polylactic acid; Printing technologies; Recovered carbon fiber; Recycled carbon fibres; Secondary Raw Materials; Sustainable materials; 3D printing","L.

This study simultaneously conducts topology optimization and fiber path design by employing the radial basis function (RBF) based level set function (LSF). Fiber paths are determined instinctively for the inherent advantages of the LSF, and fiber orientations are parameterized accordingly. Manufacturing drawbacks such as gaps and overlaps can be avoided by introducing a fast-marching method. To verify the effectiveness of the optimization method, three groups of optimized and empirical designs are fabricated by the AM technique, respectively, and the experimental tests are further carried out. Finite element (FE) models are also reconstructed based on the printing schemes, and then the FE simulation is validated by the experimental tests. With the proposed optimization method, stiffnesses for all three groups of the optimal samples are significantly improved compared with the empirical counterparts. The FE modeling technique is capable of reproducing the experimental results.

This creates a new, economically feasible and environmentally friendly design approach for injection moulded components. However, the significant differences in thermal expansion coefficients and stiffnesses between the injection moulding compound and the tape reinforcements can lead to considerable warpage of the components. To address this challenge, a multi-objective optimisation approach was developed for tape positioning in injection moulded components, taking warpage into account and, hence, unlocking the outstanding stiffening properties of tape reinforcements. The approach is based on a gradient-based topology optimisation algorithm using the finite element method.

Here, an innovative and scalable strategy was developed to enhance the interfacial adhesion of Ti/CFRP hybrid laminates, which was achieved by introducing customized woven metallic fabrics to construct a heterogeneous interface through a simple and cost-effective spot welding method. Interestingly, it was found that the interlaminar mechanical performance and failure mode transition from snap-down instability to progressive softening behavior could be precisely tuned by adjusting the distribution configurations of the welded spots. The results demonstrated substantial improvements in interlaminar fracture energies with the implementation of customized intercalation. Specifically, mode I initiation and propagation were enhanced by approximately 276% and 144%, respectively, while mode II initiation improved by approximately 242%. These improvements were attributed to the activation of new dissipative mechanisms, including interfacial topological texture interlocking, adhesive failure, multiphase bridging (involving woven metallic fabric, welded spots and carbon fiber), as well as cross-layer migration of the interlaminar cracks. The use of customized intercalation thus proves to be a promising strategy for constructing heterogeneous interface and offers valuable insights into the interlaminar design for hybrid structures. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Customizing intercalation; Fiber metal laminates; Interlaminar fracture toughness; Toughening mechanisms","Adhesives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Ductile fracture; Fibers; Fracture toughness; Spot welding; Textures; Titanium alloys; Weaving; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Customizing intercalation; Fibre Metal Laminates; Fibre reinforced polymer laminates; Heterogeneous interfaces; Interfacial mechanical properties; Interlaminar; Interlaminar fracture toughness; Metallics; Toughening mechanisms; Cost effectiveness","H.

In order to solve the closed-loop recycling of carbon fibers (CFs) and develop green economy. We synthesized aldehyde-containing bio-based benzoxazine (VD) from vanillin and 1,10-diaminodecane, the epoxy resin vitrimer matrix (P-AE-MV) was prepared by curing acrylpimaric acid diglycidyl ester (AE) with a Schiff base (MV) formed by 1,8-menthane diamine (MDA) and VD. Under the double dynamic covalent bond of Schiff base and β-hydroxy ester, P-AE-MV has a very low dynamic bond exchange activation energy Ea = 48.1 kJ mol−1, which can realize the rapid topological rearrangement of polymer network, and give P-AE-MV excellent self-healing, shape memory, reprocessability and degradability. In addition, the introduction of polybenzoxazine (PBz) structure greatly improved the mechanical properties, thermal decomposition temperature, carbon yield and hydrophobicity of epoxy resin vitrimer, which is very suitable for CFRPs matrix. The CFRP (P-AE-MV-CF) prepared with P-AE-MV as matrix resin have good mechanical properties, reprocessability, shape memory and self-adhesion. Especially, it can be rapidly ammonolysis with n-butylamine under mild conditions (60 °C), achieving efficient and non-destructive recycling of CFs.

To this end, this study aims to overcome poor wettability between reinforcing phase, i.e., carbon fiber (CF), and thermoplastic matrix, i.e., polyetherether ketone (PEEK). Herein, CF’s surface was tailored by application of different polymeric sizing agents which have different chemical structures. Morphology and topology analyses were performed by Scanning Electron Microscope and 3D laser scanning, respectively. Later, a variety of wettability results were obtained by the sessile drop method used in Contact Angle (CA) measurements for CFs throughout application of each sizing agent applied by dip coating. Sizing materials were designed such that the chemical structure of CF’s surface could exhibit compatibility with the matrix itself. Consequently, complete wettability (CA: 0°) was achieved for CFs sized by HPEEK (CF/hydroxylated PEEK (HPEEK)) and the surface free energy (SFE) of CF was enhanced from 5.43 to 72.8 mJ/m2 while the SFE of the PEEK matrix is 40.1 mJ/m2. Moreover, sizing by HPEEK improved the average surface roughness of CF by 32% which enables optimized adhesion. Afterward, repetitive tensile tests were carried out to observe effects of improved interfacial interlocking on the mechanical properties of the final CFRTP composite. Stress–strain curves revealed that the tensile strength of CFRTP improved from 473 to 508 MPa through the sizing of CF by HPEEK whereas pristine PEEK has a much smaller tensile strength (98 MPa) than the aforementioned CF-reinforced composites. Graphical abstract: The sizing of carbon fiber’s surface by HPEEK resulted in an enhanced adhesion with the PEEK matrix. Since the chemical structure and physical properties of sizing agent and matrix are compatible, potential debonding between them was eliminated. Thus, the improved wettability led to a substantial increase in the mechanical strength of the final TP composite.

The molecular structure of nanofibers is a crucial factor influencing their toughening performance, but the underlying trans-dimension structure-activity relationship remain unclear. Here, two types of polyamide-based nanofibrous veils (NF1 and NF2), characterized by distinct molecular structures, were integrated into carbon fiber/epoxy laminates to assess differences in interlaminar fracture toughness. Mode I and Mode II loading tests demonstrated significant yet distinct improvements in interlaminar fracture toughness for the two nanomodified CFRPs, attributed to intrinsic and extrinsic toughening mechanisms. NF1-modified composites exhibited superior toughening properties than NF2-modified composites, with a 186 % enhancement in GIC and a 134 % enhancement in GIIC. This superiority can be attributed to NF1's higher crystallinity, smaller diameter, stronger tensile strength, and greater interaction energy with epoxy resin, all of which are closely related to the molecular structure of the nanofibers. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provided theoretical insights into how the molecular structure of nanofibers influences interlaminar toughness. Furthermore, the original laminate static flexural properties, dynamic stiffness, and glass-transition temperature (Tg) are all maintained for NF1-modified composites, suggesting that enhancing interlaminar toughness can compensate for potential declines in mechanical and thermomechanical properties. Consequently, the multi-level structure-activity relationship between polymer molecular structure, nanofiber morphology, interlaminar topology, and composite macroscopic properties was established to pave the way for precise atomic-level construction of interlaminar structures in laminates. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Continuous fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composites; Interlaminar toughness; Molecular dynamics simulations; Nanofibrous veil; Polyamide","Building materials; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Crystal atomic structure; Elastomers; Fracture toughness; Laminated composites; Religious buildings; Silicones; Solar buildings; Carbon fibre/epoxy laminates; Continuous fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composite; Continuous fibers; Dynamics simulation; Fibre reinforced polymer matrix composite; Interlaminar toughness; Modified composites; Molecular dynamic simulation; Nano-fibrous; Nanofibrous veil; Tensile strength","W.

The loading of Graphene has significantly enhanced the mechanical strength, which in turn caused challenges with machining and adversely affected the quality and surface characteristics. It is extensively used in the production of high-performance structural components. In this investigation, reduced Graphene Oxide (rGO) have been loaded in Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) composites and compared to unreinforced CFRP composites. This reveals, rGO nanofiller positively affected tensile and impact strength. This article investigates the Abrasive water jet machining (AWJM) performances of rGO-modified CFRP composites after the development of composite samples. The influence of AWJM factors and mathematical correlation between AWJM response characteristics like Kerf Taper Angle (KT°), Volume Removal Rate (VRR), Average Roughness (Ra), and Maximum Delamination Length (Max. DLL) was explored. The process variables considered as Stand-off Distance (SOD), Traverse Rate (TR), and Jet Pressure (JP), on CFRP composite with various rGO weight fractions. The Response Surface Methodology (RSM)-based statistical technique was utilized to identify the most crucial and optimal conditions during AWJ machining. ANOVA examines the impact of various inputs on the machining performance. While experimentation, the optimal values for AWJM parameters were determined as SOD = 1.0 mm, TR = 300 mm/min, JP = High (≈ 300 MPa), and the 0.5 wt.% rGO/CFRP was found to have KT° (0.879°), VRR (1393.699 mm3/min), Ra (1.716 µm), and Max. DLL (1.146 mm), which provides an aggregate desirability score of 0.886. The findings revealed that the TR and JP were shown to have a more significant effect on the KT°, VRR, and Ra, while the rGO weight fraction was observed to have a substantial consequence on the Max. DLL. Additionally, the microstructural and topological characterizations of the machined surface revealed that defects could be controlled by incorporating rGO nanofiller into the CFRP. The proposed nanocomposite machining aspects could be endorsed for an efficient manufacturing environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering 2024.","Abrasive water jet machining; CFRP; Delamination; Kerf taper; Nanocomposites; Reduced graphene oxide","Abrasion; Abrasives; Bending moments; Carbon carbon composites; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Cracks; Fracture mechanics; Graphene oxide; Hydroelasticity; Impact strength; Machinability; Machining centers; Nanoparticles; Reduced Graphene Oxide; Rolling resistance; Silicones; Superplasticity; Tensile strength; Abrasive water jet machining; Carbon-fiber reinforced plastic composites; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Delamination length; Jet pressures; Kerf taper; Reduced graphene oxides; Taper angles; Traverse rate; Volume removal rates; Delamination","R.K.

Recently, the use of fiber-reinforced composite material structures in fields such as mechanical engineering and aerospace technology has significantly increased. However, the performance of fiber-reinforced mechanical metamaterials based on TPMS has not yet been reported. Therefore, herein, the changes in the vibration isolation and energy absorption performance of TPMS mechanical metamaterials after fiber reinforcement are investigated. Thermoplastic polyurethane is used as the matrix material for the structure and T300 carbon fibers as the reinforcing phase material. First, the equivalent material parameters of TPMS mechanical metamaterials reinforced with carbon fibers using theoretical and finite element methods are obtained. Second, the quasi-static compression characteristics of mechanical metamaterials are analyzed. Finally, the band structure and energy absorption properties of the TPMS structures are examined. The numerical simulation results show that fiber reinforcement can significantly enhance the stiffness and impact resistance of TPMS mechanical metamaterials. The study provides theoretical guidance for the design and manufacture of mechanical metamaterials and their applications in future aircraft. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","energy-absorbing structures; fiber reinforcement; mechanical metamaterials; triply periodic minimal surfaces; vibration isolating","Air navigation; Carbon fibers; Energy absorption; Fiber reinforced plastics; Vibrations (mechanical); Composite material structure; Energy; Energy absorbing structure; Fiber reinforcement (e); Fiber-reinforced composite material; Fibre-reinforced; Mechanical; Mechanical metamaterial; Triply periodic minimal surfaces; Vibration isolating; Metamaterials","H.

To investigate the physical properties, chemical properties and microstructure of wood ceramics prepared from biomass materials, the basic properties and potential applications of wood ceramics were expounded. In this paper, wood powder wood ceramics (WPWC) and wood fiber wood ceramics (WFWC) were prepared through the vacuum carbonization method, utilizing pine powder and pine fiber as raw materials. The impact of phenolic resin concentration and mixture filling mass on various properties of wood ceramics, including mass loss rate (MLR), volume shrinkage rate (VSR), apparent porosity (AP), and bending strength (BS) were investigated on this basis. The microtopography and pore structure of wood ceramics were also analyzed. The test results show that an increase in the concentration of phenolic resin led to a decrease in the MLR, VSR, and AP of WPWC and WFWC, while their BS exhibited an increase. When the concentration of phenolic resin was 60 %, the phenolic resin yielded a BS of 8.70 MPa and 9.20 MPa for WPWC and WFWC, respectively. Furthermore, the microstructures of both WPFC and WFWC reveal hierarchical porous structures. The difference is that WPFC has a dispersed three-dimensional network topology in its overall morphology, which is mainly formed by filamentous or long linear glass carbon in wood ceramics dominated by carbon. The natural and consistent pore structure of WFWC is comparable to a three-dimensional honeycomb structure, the primary mesoporous size was around 40.28 nm and the main macropore size was more than 10,000 nm. It elucidates the pore structure of WPWC and WFWC, characterized by “hierarchical porosity”, the differences and relationships between porous wood ceramics derived from powdery and fibrous biomass as raw materials were analyzed, which contributes to the advancement of the fundamental principles of wood ceramics and establishes a theoretical basis for the practical exploration and development of biomass materials. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH.

The nature or even presence of the interphase, a localized region around the fibre-matrix junction, is often discussed but notoriously difficult to visualize and characterise. Here, a surface-initiated electro-polymerization approach to covalently graft either polyacrylamide or polygylcidyl methacrylate to the carbon fibres was used. This was followed by continuous melt compounding into the polyamide-6 matrix prior to injection moulding. Analysis via X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) coupled with topological/visual study through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), showed distinct surface changes after modification and at the composite fracture surface. Additionally, mechanical (tensile, flexural, and tribological characteristics) and thermal (differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)) investigations were performed. The results showed that the unmodified CF samples exhibit higher tensile and flexural modulus than the modified CF samples. However, the wear rate has been significantly decreased for modified CF samples. SEM of fractured composite surfaces showcased a clear interphase region surrounding the fibre, highlighting the importance of interphase/interphase mechanics in the design of optimal composite interfaces. © 2024","Carbon fibre reinforced composites; Injection moulding; Interphase mechanics; Mechanical assessment; Polyamide 6; Thermoplastics","Carbon carbon composites; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Compounding (chemical); Differential thermal analysis; Elastomers; Grafting (chemical); Ionomers; Molding; Polyamides; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Chemical compatibility; Flexural performance; Interfacial adhesions; Interphase mechanic; Localised; Mechanical; Mechanical assessment; Polyamide 6; Scanning electrons; Thermogravimetric analysis","L.C.

Fins are flat structures extending from the body of a rocket to provide stability during flight. The Cavour rocket has removable fins, which are more complex to design than epoxied fins. However, they offer multi-mission capability and are easily replaceable in case of any structural damage. Cavour's fins are made of Onyx polymer reinforced with continuous carbon fibers. The distribution and orientation of the fibers were chosen based on fin flutter analysis to minimize the effects on the rocket's stability. The joining arcs connect the four fins to create a unique assembly directly inserted into the rocket's body tube. The arcs need to be stiff enough to withstand the stresses from the fins and the motor to which they are attached. A topology optimization workflow has been utilized to achieve optimal stiffness and weight, followed by a static and modal analysis to ensure that the joining arcs do not resonate with the fins. Based on the results of the performed studies, the team proposed an innovative design approach. The joining arcs were 3D printed with Onyx polymer reinforced with continuous carbon fiber near the contact surfaces with the fins. It was found that the proposed configuration fulfilled the requirements established by the previous analyses, which was confirmed by three successful launches. The modal analysis showed that natural frequencies of the joining arcs with high participation factors should significantly differ from those obtained from the analyses of fin flutter. The assembly remained rigid, and the mounting place of the fins assembly didn't affect the performance of the fins. The Spaceport America Cup 2023 jury recognized the student team's work, and the team received the Dr. Gill Moore Award for Innovation.

The versatile applications, which are intended to improve life in cities in various aspects, have one thing in common-they rely on widespread, reliable, and high-performing communication networks. Therefore, optical-access networks will be a crucial part of the smart cities' network infrastructure as they provide cost-effective and high-speed connectivity to antenna sites, residents, enterprises, businesses, and regional data centers in a point-to-multipoint topology. In this article, we address the overall impact of this urban transformation on such networks. We outline our vision of the future smart sustainable city, which will leverage advanced optical-access networks. Subsequently, the physical layer design of optical-access networks is analyzed in the context of point-to-multipoint network topology. This includes a 100-Gbit/s intensity-modulation and direct-detection passive optical network (PON) and a 200-Gbit/s coherent PON utilizing eight-digital subcarrier-based time- and wavelength-division multiplexing and coherent detection. We discuss artificial intelligence-based network monitoring and resource allocation. Next, we provide a techno-economical study for sustainable fiber deployment strategies.

Three cases are considered: (i) cold-rolled interstitial-free (IF) steel, warm-rolled IF steel at 550 °C and warm rolled Fe-Si steel at 900 °C (below the austenitization temperature due to Si). It is well-known that the deformation texture after flat rolling of single-ferrite low carbon steels exhibits the characteristic α/γ-fiber texture, i.e. <110>//Rolling Direction (RD) and <111>//Normal Direction (ND), irrespective of the rolling temperature, as long as there is no concurrent phase transformation. However, different recrystallisation textures appear as a function of the rolling temperature. Generally speaking, the γ-fiber recrystallisation texture is obtained after cold rolling, whereas the θ-fiber components ( <100>//ND) intensify at the expense of the γ-fiber orientations with increasing rolling temperature. Although these phenomena are well-known, the reasons for this behavior in terms of preferential orientation selection remain as yet unclear. In the present paper, recrystallisation microstructures and textures are simulated with a full-field cellular-automaton (CA) description, whereby recrystallisation from its incipient stage is considered as a process of sub-grain coarsening controlled by the well-known physical laws of driving force and kinetics. The simulations integrate in one single model the various conditions that give rise to the observed temperature dependence of the evolving static recrystallisation texture and microstructure. The different rolling temperatures will give rise to different initial microstructures at the onset of recrystallisation with noticeable variations in short-range orientation gradients in γ and θ-fiber orientations, respectively. The mere application of local grain-boundary migration laws on the topology of the deformation structure, without imposing any specific nucleation selection criterion, will properly balance the dominance of γ-fiber grains after cold-rolling and θ-fiber orientations after warm rolling. Finally, the well-known nucleation of Goss orientations ({110}<001>) in shear bands occurring in γ-fiber grains is also simulated in this single conceptual framework. © 2024 The Authors","Abnormal subgrain growth; Deformation temperature; Full-field simulation; Recrystallisation nucleation; Recrystallisation texture","Aluminum cladding; Coarsening; Crystal microstructure; Crystallization kinetics; Direct reduction process; Grain growth; Grain size and shape; Neodymium alloys; Recrystallization (metallurgy); Silicon steel; Superconducting materials; Textures; Abnormal subgrain growths; Deformation temperatures; Fibre orientation; Field simulation; Full-field simulation; Recrystallisation; Recrystallization nucleation; Recrystallization texture; Rolling temperature; γ fibers; Low carbon steel","K.

The developed MEQS method was first illustrated against EQS and Offset methods using an open-hole composite plate in which topology and material orientation were simultaneously optimised using the discrete–continuous parameterisation (DCP) method. Actual printing path-based finite element modelling showed that the MEQS method achieves a 25.32% increase in stiffness compared to the Offset method. Experimental testing of the additively manufactured open-hole composite plates showed that the MEQS method improves the stiffness and strength by 15.52% and 27.38%, respectively, compared to the Offset method. The proposed MEQS was further demonstrated through two other case studies by finite element modelling, showing that the stiffness of MEQS has increased by an average of 66.71% and 14.95% compared to EQS and Offset, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s)","Additive manufacturing; Continuous fibres; Finite element analysis; Printing path planning; Topology optimisation","Additives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Finite element method; Motion planning; Plates (structural components); Stiffness; Structure (composition); Topology; Composite plates; Composites structures; Continuous fibers; Element models; Fibre placement; Finite element analyse; Offset method; Open holes; Printing path planning; Topology optimisation; 3D printing","J.

While the strength of sandwich panels with lattice cores is influenced by the material and topology, the mechanical properties of these structures have to be enhanced. It requires the use of high-strength materials, so this research presents a composite sandwich structure containing carbon fiber sheets 0/90 with epoxy used as the sandwich skin., while epoxy is used as the pyramid core. Two basic pyramidal geometries are designed according to the ASTM C393-00 standard, investigated under a three-point bending test by quasi-static bending loads, and explored to explore the effect of different basic unit cell topologies and core densities on the mechanical behavior of the sandwich.

Fiber mode-locked lasers mainly include active and passive mode-locked fiber lasers. The passive mode-locked fiber laser is a simple and economical method to realize ultrafast pulse generation. Saturable absorbers play an important role in passive mode-locked fiber lasers. In recent years, different kinds of saturable absorbers (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene, topological insulators, transition metal chalcogenides, and black phosphorus) have been used to generate ultrafast pulses. In this paper, we use the magnetron sputtering deposited WTe2 as a saturable absorber to achieve ultrafast pulse generation in an erbium-doped fiber laser. With the wavelength of 1559.31 nm, the measured 3 dB spectral bandwidth is 11.54 nm and the pulse duration is 231 fs. The ultra-short pulse with the maximum average output power of 58 mW and the pulse energy of 2.18 nJ is obtained at the fundamental frequency of 26.6 MHz. The results indicate that the WTe2 saturable absorber can be used as an excellent photonic device to generate ultra-short pulses at 1.5 μm band. Methods To study the nonlinear properties of the WTe2 saturable absorber based on micro-nanofiber, we apply the device in an erbium-doped fiber laser to generate ultrafast pulses at a 1.5 μm band. The pump source is a commercial 980 nm laser diode (LD) with a maximum output power of 400 mW. A 1.5 m long erbium-doped fiber is used as the gain medium. The optical coupler has a spectral ratio of 50∶50. The length of the entire resonant cavity is about 9.3 m. A polarization controller is utilized to adjust the polarization state of the oscillating beam in the cavity, while a polarization-independent optical isolator is used to ensure unidirectional operation. In addition to the erbium-doped fiber, the other fibers including the pigtails of each component are SMF-28e fibers. In fiber laser systems, all components are polarization-independent, which avoids self-starting mode-locking operation caused by nonlinear polarization evolution. It is worth noting that in erbium-doped fiber laser systems, the direction of the laser is opposite to that of the pumping laser, avoiding the output of residual pump power. The output characteristics of the laser are measured by spectrometers (Yokogawa AQ63700), oscilloscopes (ROHDE & SCHWARZ RTO2024), and photodetectors (EOT ET-3500F). We use an emission spectrum analyzer (ROHDE & SCHWARZ FSV13) to record the emission spectrum during mode-locked operation, and a commercial autocorrelator (APE Pulsecheck) to measure the pulse width. Results and Discussions With the increase in pump power, the cavity is initially in continuous operation. When the pump power reaches 40 mW, we observe a self-starting stable mode-locking. When the pump power reaches a maximum of 400 mW, it still maintains a stable mode-locked operation state, with the maximum average output power of 58 mW and the corresponding pulse energy of 2.18 nJ. The measurement results of the spectrum of the output pulse ranging from 900 to 1700 nm show no pump signal at 980 nm, indicating no residual pump power. When the pump power reaches the maximum, the output power basically still maintains a linear increase, with a slope of 15.3%. The mode-locking performance is characterized at the maximum pump power. The mode-locking spectrum centered at 1559.31 nm is obtained with a 3 dB spectral bandwidth of 11.54 nm. The Kelly sideband on the spectrum confirms that the mode-locked laser operates in the soliton region. The autocorrelation curve of the mode-locked pulse with a full width at half maximum of 356 fs is obtained, and can be well fitted by the sech2(·) curve. With a de-correlation factor of 0.648, the actual pulse width is calculated to be 231 fs. In addition to the excellent nonlinear properties of WTe2 materials, erbium-doped fibers feature large dispersion compensation, with a dispersion parameter of 36 ps2/km at 1560 nm, which also helps realize ultra-short pulses. Since the dispersion parameter of the single-mode fiber at 1560 nm is -22 ps2/km, the total group velocity dispersion is about -0.12 ps2. In addition, the time-bandwidth product is 0.33, indicating slight pulse chirps. Further compression with certain methods is possible. Conclusions The saturable absorber of WTe2 based on micro-nanofiber is prepared by magnetron sputtering technology, and its nonlinear optical properties are studied. The micro-nanofiber WTe2 saturable absorber is embedded in an erbium doped fiber laser system with a ring cavity structure. At 1559.31 nm, the measured 3 dB spectral bandwidth is 11.54 nm and the pulse width is 231 fs. The mode-locked laser output with the highest average output power of 58 mW and the pulse energy of 2.18 nJ is obtained at the fundamental frequency of 26.6 MHz. The results show that WTe2 saturable absorber can be used as an excellent photonic device to generate ultrafast pulses at 1.5 μm band. In addition, magnetron sputtering deposition technology is expected to prepare high-performance saturable absorbers with large modulation depth, low nonsaturable loss, and low saturable intensity, which is conducive to the generation of ultrafast pulses with high stability and high power. © 2024 Chinese Optical Society.","erbium-doped fiber; lasers; magnetron sputtering deposition; micro-nanofiber; mode-locking; WTe<sub>2</sub>","Bragg gratings; Copper; Fiber lasers; Four wave mixing; High modulus textile fibers; Image sensors; Iron; Keyways; Laser accessories; Light polarization; Mineral wool; Mode-locked fiber lasers; Optical pumping; Passive mode locking; Photodetectors; Photoelectric cells; Photoelectric microscopes; Photographic emulsions; Photographic films; Single mode fibers; Tungsten; Ultrashort pulses; Waveguide isolators; Zinc oxide; 1.5 μm; Erbium- doped fibers; Erbium-doped fiber lasers; Magnetron-sputtering deposition; Micro/nano fibers; Modelocked lasers; Modelocking; Passive mode-locked fiber lasers; Pump power; Ultrafast pulse; Saturable absorbers","J.

It serves as an alternative to Automated Fiber/Tape Placement processes, offering cost-effective machinery and the programmability advantage of 3D printers. By bypassing pre-impregnated products, WFP enables the blending of preferred resins and fibers, providing enhanced geometric flexibility and material versatility. Two major challenges go along with this process strategy: (1) the freshly impregnated rovings tend to adhere to any surface they come in contact with, while (2) the impregnated rovings are slack and must be pulled rather than pushed all the way from the creel to the point where they leave the placement system. After placement, the generated “in-line prepreg” is consolidated and cured in a compression molding process, using an elastomeric/metallic, thickness-adaptive tool that can be used to process different workpieces with different thicknesses and workpieces with locally differing thicknesses in the same mold. This paper introduces a CNC system tailored for WFP, emphasizing the end effector’s components like pultrusion rollers, dancer modules, a cutting unit, and pre-consolidation elements. Despite successful roving placement, accuracy concerns persist, suggesting the need for sensor synchronization and cutting path optimization. Initial prepreg compression molding trials showcased thickness adaptability with minimal fiber displacement, offering potential for topology optimization, albeit demanding further parameter study to enhance product quality. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2024.","Additive manufacturing; Carbon fibers; Composites; Thickness adaptive press; Wet fiber placement","3D printing; Compression molding; Cost effectiveness; End effectors; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Adaptive compression; Compression molding process; Continuous fibers; Fibre placement; Fibre-reinforced composite; Manufacturing technologies; Prepregs; Thickness adaptive press; Wet fiber placement; Workpiece; Blending","P.A.

This research addresses the need for a high-performance, mold-independent approach for complex topological optimized components. We introduce the hot powder bed compaction (HPBC) technique, which combines fused filament fabrication (FFF) with a flexible compaction process. HPBC enables to creation of complex, high-performance thermoplastic composite parts, featuring topology-optimized geometry with tailored fiber orientation, without the need for part-specific tooling. This rapid fabrication approach is controlled by the time-temperature-pressure parameters to ensure inter-layer fusion without loss of the geometrical shape of the part. The structural rocker component was optimized for four load cases and printed with polyamide reinforced with short and long carbon fibers using the FFF process. Notably, HPBC results demonstrated improved mechanical performance compared to as-printed FFF. HPBC-treated coupon showed a 25.72% increase in flexural modulus (14.76 GPa) and a 27.77% increase in flexural strength (360 MPa). Moreover, the topologically optimized rocker exhibited a notable 30% increase in strength compared to the pristine counterpart, this improved performance was attributed to enhanced interlayer fusion and void infusion during reconsolidation, as demonstrated in micrographs. This research demonstrates that HPBC is a versatile and effective method for producing high-performance, complex-shaped, void-free composite parts with optimized fiber orientation, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional FFF. © 2024 Soc. for the Advancement of Material and Process Engineering.

Thus, developing an effective structural health monitoring system is essential. This study presents CFRP-former, a novel deep learning framework that detects damage in CFRP composites by constructing spatio-temporal representation graphs of Lamb waves (LWs). The CFRP-former comprises three key modules: graph convolutional neural network (GCNN), a multi-layer perceptron (MLP), and a Transformer Encoder. The GCNN models the topological relationships between LW nodes and sensors. The MLP reduces data dimensionality while preserving key information for subsequent analysis. Meanwhile, the Transformer Encoder, employing multi-head attention mechanisms, captures global time-series patterns in the LW signals. Additionally, the CFRP-former framework includes a parallel module that separately predicts both the size and location of damage. Experiments using only four sensors show that CFRP-former achieves high accuracy in detecting and quantifying damage, with robustness confirmed through ablation tests. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP); Damage detection; Deep learning (DL); Lamb waves (LWs); Structural health monitoring (SHM)","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Ion acoustic waves; Multilayer neural networks; Plasma shock waves; Rayleigh waves; Structural health monitoring; Ultrasonic waves; Carbon fiber reinforced plastic; Carbon-fiber reinforced plastic composites; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Health monitoring; Lamb wave; Multilayers perceptrons; Structural health; Structural health monitoring","K.

Herein, a facile collagen microstructure modulation strategy is proposed to construct a nitrogen/oxygen dual-doped hierarchically porous carbon fiber with ultrahigh specific surface area (2788 m2 g−1) and large pore volume (4.56 cm3 g−1) via local microfibrous breakage/disassembly of natural structured proteins. Combining operando spectroscopy and density functional theory unveil that the dual-heteroatom doping could effectively regulate the electronic structure of carbon atom framework with enhanced electric conductivity and electronegativity as well as decreased diffusion resistance in favor of rapid pseudocapacitive-dominated Li+-storage (353 mAh g−1 at 10 A g−1). Theoretical calculations reveal that the tailored micro−/mesoporous structures favor the rapid charge transfer and ion storage, synergistically realizing high capacity and superior rate performance for NPCF-H cathode (75.0 mAh g−1 at 30 A g−1). The assembled device with NPCF-H as both anode and cathode achieves extremely high energy density (200 Wh kg−1) with maximum power density (42 600 W kg−1) and ultralong lifespan (80% capacity retention over 10 000 cycles). © 2022 The Authors.

However, their limited oxidation resistance and low thermomechanical stability in hot air impose constraints on their utilization. Here, we present an approach to simultaneously achieve high thermomechanical properties and high-temperature oxidation resistance in carbon-ceramic hybrid fibers featuring a highly aligned co-continuous topological structure through a continuous process. These hybrid fibers exhibit superior mechanical properties compared to pure carbon fibers with the same diameter (20 μm), including a tensile strength of 2.0 ± 0.2 GPa, Young's modulus of 175 ± 34 GPa, and elongation at break of 1.3 ± 0.2%. Moreover, when subjected to thermal exposure under stress loading conditions in air, the ceramic constituents form a protective oxidized ceramic layer that effectively mitigates thermal oxidation and mechanical loading effects at elevated temperatures, surpassing the performance of carbon fibers. Our discovery offers a promising avenue for bridging the performance gap between cost-effective high-strength carbon fibers and expensive SiC counterparts with exceptional oxidation resistance, which can be applied in many fields wherever high thermomechanical loading and oxidation-resistant properties are important. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Ceramic fibers; High modulus textile fibers; Silicon carbide; Thermooxidation; carbon; carbon fiber; Carbon-ceramic; Cost-efficiency; High temperature oxidation resistance; Hot air; Hybrid fiber; Mechanical; Property; Synergistic enhancement; Thermomechanical properties; Thermomechanical stability; article; ceramics; continuous process; controlled study; fiber; high temperature; hybrid; nonhuman; oxidation; pharmaceutics; synergistic effect; temperature; tensile strength; thermal exposure; Tensile strength","X.

However, the potential of 3D carbon fabrication is constrained when utilizing state-of-the-art feedstock and manufacturing routes. To address these limitations, a 3D carbon fabrication strategy is developed named carbonizable filament technology (CAFIT). In CAFIT, the evolution of high-loaded carbon composite filaments broadens the capabilities of straightforward 3D printing technology by ensuring structural stability for subsequent post-carbonization to achieve scalable and engineered 3D carbon structures. This strategy has strengths regarding 1) simplicity, 2) applicability to a variety of carbon materials, and 3) creating nearly replicated 3D carbon structures with multiscale features. The fundamental mechanisms governing the processability of the universal filament and structural change of carbon particles throughout the process using carbon nanotubes as an example are explored. Moreover, through simulation and demonstration, the adaptability of CAFIT is illustrated by utilizing a wide range of carbon materials, including low-dimensional nano/micro carbons (carbon blacks, carbon nanotubes, and graphenes), as well as carbon fibers, to fabricate 3D architected carbon structures. © 2024 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","3D carbon architectures; 3D printing; carbonizable filaments; Li-ion battery applications","3D printing; Carbon carbon composites; Carbon nanotubes; Carbonization; Stability; 3-D printing; 3d carbon architecture; 3D-printing; Battery applications; Carbon additives; Carbon material; Carbon structures; Carbonizable filament; Li-ion battery application; Tunables; Lithium-ion batteries","K.

The carbon fiber composite hexagonal honeycomb panels were fabricated using the hot press molding method. Then, low-velocity drop-weight impact tests on the composite honeycomb panels were conducted under impact energy levels of 5J, 10J, 30J, 50J, 60J, 70J, and 100J to study the deformation mechanisms and damage modes. The VUMAT was developed to model the behavior of sandwich panels, in which a progressive damage model based on the strain-based failure criterion of composite fabric and Yeh delamination failure criteria was implemented in ABAQUS/Explicit. Two-dimensional topological honeycomb configurations with the same relative density were established. The energy absorption and load-bearing capacity of hexagonal, square, triangular, Kagome, and two kinds of circular (CS and CH types) honeycombs under 100J impact energy were discussed. The results showed that the circular honeycomb (CH type) had the largest first peak force of 6.714 kN, while the hexagonal honeycomb had the smallest first peak force of 3.715 kN. Compared with hexagonal honeycomb, the energy absorption of the triangle, Kagome, and circular honeycombs (CH type) were increased by 37.15%, 38.18%, and 47.06%, respectively. This study provided a series of experimental and numerical results, which could provide a reference for selecting suitable honeycomb configurations in the protection field. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Carbon fiber composite honeycomb; Damage modes; Deformation process; Finite element analysis; Low-velocity impact","ABAQUS; Carbon fibers; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Honeycomb structures; Sandwich structures; Carbon fiber composite honeycomb; Carbon fibre composites; Circular honeycombs; Damage modes; Deformation process; Failure criteria; Finite element analyse; Hexagonal honeycomb; Honeycomb panels; Low velocity impact; Finite element method","X.

Conventional vibration reduction structures cannot meet the requirements for lightweight, high load capacity, low frequency and broadband vibration reduction. Therefore, it is necessary to consider new structural topologies and material systems. Inspired by the lightweight and high strength characteristics of composite materials, the negative Poisson's ratio characteristics and the locally resonating phononic crystal, the carbon fiber composite auxetic structure embedded with resonators is proposed. Embedded resonators within composite auxetic structures can be strategically positioned to introduce gaps, thereby enhancing the vibration damping performance. The basic auxetic structure is prepared by simpler methods including molding and bonding, and the outer shell of resonator is made by 3D printing technology. The method enables the design of appropriate outer shell based on various cavity types within the structure, ensuring a stable connection between resonators and the structure itself. The range of the band gap can be predicted based on the negative effective mass. Vibration behavior and band gap characteristics of the structure are proved through vibration experiments and numerical simulations. It is revealed that the structure can generate local resonant band gaps at lower frequencies. Meanwhile, the coupling relationship between the auxetic structure and the resonator makes an impact to the band gap range. Therefore, the proposed structure can meet the required multi-functional integrated performance requirements. Furthermore, the parametric analysis is carried out, and the relevant conclusions can provide theoretical guidance for designing porous composite structures with effective low-broadband vibration reduction capabilities. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Composite materials; Locally resonant phononic crystals; Negative effective mass; Negative Poisson's ratio; Resonator","Carbon carbon composites; Poisson ratio; Shipyards; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Vibration analysis; Auxetic structures; Broadband vibration; Composites material; Locally resonant phononic crystal; Negative effective mass; Negative Poisson ratio; Outer shells; Performance requirements; Phononic Crystal; Vibration reductions; Aerospace industry","J.-S.

They rely on externally triggered bond exchange reactions, which induce topological rearrangements and, at a sufficiently high rate, a macroscopic reflow of the polymer network. Due to this controlled change in viscosity, dynamic polymers are repairable, malleable, and reprocessable. Herein, several dynamic polyurethane networks were synthetized as model compounds, which were able to undergo thermo-activated transcarbamoylation for the use in rebondable adhesives. Ethylenediamine-N,N,N′,N′-tetra-2-propanol (EDTP) was applied as a transcarbamoylation catalyst, which participates in the curing reaction across its four -OH groups and thus, is covalently attached within the polyurethane network. Both bond exchange rate and (thermo)mechanical properties of the dynamic networks were readily adjusted by the crosslink density and availability of -OH groups. In a last step, the most promising model compound was optimized to prepare an adhesive formulation more suitable for a real case application. Single-lap shear tests were carried out to evaluate the bond strength of this final formulation in adhesively bonded carbon fiber reinforced polymers (CFRP). Exploiting the dynamic nature of the adhesive layer, the debonded CFRP test specimens were rebonded at elevated temperature. The results clearly show that thermally triggered rebonding was feasible by recovering up to 79% of the original bond strength. © 2024 by the authors.","adhesives; dynamic polymers; rebonding; thermo-activated transcarbamoylation; vitrimers","Bond strength (chemical); Bond strength (materials); Crosslinking; Elastomers; Ionomers; Plastic adhesives; Polyurethanes; Thermosets; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Dynamic polymer; Model compound; OH-groups; Polymer networks; Polyurethane networks; Rebonding; Synthesis and characterizations; Thermo-activated transcarbamoylation; Vitrimer; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","S.

Firstly, the structural topology optimization design of carbon fiber composite plates was achieved using a multi-scale modeling approach with the variable density method. Nonlinear relationships between carbon fiber bundle configuration parameters and macroscopic equivalent properties, as well as macroscale topological flexibility, were determined using deep learning methods, respectively. The maximum error in the predicted values of the deep learning network model does not exceed 0.5% when compared with the results of the finite element calculations. In addition, utilizing deep learning networks to predict macro-equivalent properties of composites can significantly decrease computational time. The impact of varying the number of filaments in fiber bundles and the spacing of the fiber bundles on the flexibility of the topology was determined using a deep learning network. The optimal topological flexibility, along with its corresponding fiber bundle spacing and number of fiber bundle filaments, are globally searched within the design domain using an adaptive genetic algorithm.

In view of that, this article proposes a 3-D measurement method of visual axis pointing based on a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensor network and a data processing method that combines the support vector machine regression (SVR), the error backpropagation neural network (BPNN), the inverse finite element (iFEM), and the centroid-angle-normal vector (CANV) algorithm. A carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composite laminate simulating the support surface of a camera installation platform is used as an experimental object. The topological layout of an FBG sensor network is designed using the iFEM algorithm, and an experimental system is constructed. A residual-structured SVR-BPNN cascade model is developed and trained to process the FBG sensing data. The high-precision measurement of the full-field thermal-induced strain and 3-D displacement is realized. On this basis, the visual axis pointing is obtained by the CANV algorithm, and the accuracy is verified. The results show that the proposed method can effectively measure the change in visual axis pointing caused by thermal deformations of a camera installation platform. The proposed method can be used in the field of on-orbit monitoring of visual axis pointing of high-resolution remote sensing satellites. © 2025 IEEE.","Artificial neural network; fiber optic sensing; inverse finite element (iFEM); on-orbit monitoring; visual axis pointing","Displacement measurement; Electrospinning; Gluing; Network security; Optical remote sensing; Religious buildings; Solar buildings; Strain measurement; Velocity measurement; Fiber Bragg Grating Sensors; Fiber-optic sensing; Inverse finite elements; Measurement methods; Neural-networks; On orbit; On-orbit monitoring; Remote sensing satellites; Sensors network; Visual axis pointing; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","L.

Of great concern, this methodology extrapolates surface defect information from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of composite fracture surfaces. This study predicts changes in topological intensity of composite fracture surfaces and display them as real-time surface intensity values for the first time. Design/methodology/approach: This work, however, introduces a novel robust edge detection method – based image processing – as it is shown to be effective in locating defects, as measured by SEM images of composite fracture surfaces created using additive manufacturing (AM). SEM images, obtained in this study, are related to previous study considering the fracture surfaces of reinforced thermoset composites created via the AM method. These SEM images are of two types: fracture surface of AM of carbon fiber reinforced thermoset composites and fracture surface of AM of syntactic foam reinforced thermoset composites. Initially, MATLAB environment is used for analyzing the SEM images; the technique used, as well as the validity are explained more in the methodology section. Findings: The robust surface defect inspection approach used herein is found to be capable of predicting, identifying, localizing and labeling surface defects during production, allowing for real-time surface issue diagnosis. Further, this work makes it possible to use image processing and analysis of these surfaces to anticipate fluctuations in the topological intensity of the fracture surfaces of composites and represent them as values of surface intensity in real time. Originality/value: Rising worldwide company rivalry requires a fast, accurate component failure diagnostic method. To create an efficient feature set, a surface defect inspection system must identify product flaws in real time. Thus, this study proposed an image-based robust edge detection system – based on MATLAB environment – that is capable of estimating, identifying, locating and labeling surface faults during production. This paves the way for an extensive set of high-quality tools for dealing with a wide range of problems associated with digital image processing in composites.

Additionally, machine learning (ML) and explainable ML (XML) have offered various opportunities to provide reliable predictable models. The current article investigates the use of finite element modeling (FEM), ML and XML predictions, and uncertain-based design of carbon-carbon (C-C) composites for use in ultra-high temperatures. A C-C composite concentrating solar power (CSP) as a microvascular receiver is considered as a case study. These C-C composites are fiber composites with directly integrated carbonized microchannels to form a lightweight, high-absorptivity material that includes an embedded microvascular network of channels. The topology of these microchannels is engineered to optimize heat transfer to a supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) heat transfer fluid. The mechanical characterization of C-C composites is highly challenging. Thus, designing every component made of C-C composites for ultra-high temperature applications needs an uncertainty-based analysis. As a part of a comprehensive project on the development of a novel carbonized microvascular C-C composite, this paper explores C-C composite sensitivity analysis, FEM, ML prediction, and XML analysis. The resulting composite can then be carbonized and coated with an oxidation-resistant coating to form a thermally efficient and mechanically robust C-C composite. An ANSYS 3-D-FE model was used to analyze the CSP’s stress/strain. To consider the variability in the mechanical and thermal properties of C-C composites, various mechanical properties are considered as the ANSYS FEM’s input. A synthetic dataset from 730 ANSYS runs was produced to feed into the ML and XML algorithms for uncertainty analysis and prediction. The ML and XML algorithms could accurately predict the CSP stresses/strains. © 2025 by the authors.","carbon–carbon composites; design under uncertainty; finite element ANSYS; machine learning; solar energy; structural integrity","","V.

The layer-wise architecture limits their use in complex 3D geometries and leads to uneven structural performance in multi-axial load scenarios. This study introduces a novel planar fibre-winding process for manufacturing topologically optimized composite structures. The proposed method utilizes a continuous process where a carbon fibre roving is wound onto a complex 3D printed winding core. This approach enables the creation of a truss-like structure that closely follows the optimal load paths. The winding process is automated using a 3-axis gantry system, allowing precise fibre placement to form spatially complex structures. The mechanical performance of a complex wound structures was evaluated against traditionally milled aluminium parts. Tensile testing of dry rovings and composite samples provide insights into the effects of process-induced damage on the mechanical performance of the composites. Significant performance improvements compared to conventional metal component design is achieved. The composite structures showed a 55 % reduction in weight compared to milled aluminium components, while achieving a 160 % increase in specific stiffness in out-of-plane bending tests. The process also demonstrates high reproducibility and minimized material waste. The advanced fibre-winding process offers a promising composite manufacturing technique. © 2024 The Authors","3D composites; Automated fibre placement; Carbon composites; Fibre winding; Manufacturing; Topology optimization","","O.

Over the past two decades, many different topological structures including triangular, square, hexagonal, and circular units were investigated, and the basic mechanical responses of honeycomb structures under various load conditions, including tension, compression, buckling, shear, and fatigue were studied. To further improve the performance of the honeycombs, appropriate optimizations were also carried out. However, the mechanical properties of a single lattice often struggle to exceed the upper limit of its structure. This paper investigates the effect of permutation and hybrid mode on the mechanical properties of CFRCLSs by comparing five structures: rhomboid (R-type), octagon orthogonal array (OOA-type), octagon hypotenuse array (OHA-type), octagon nested array (ONA-type), and rhomboid circle (RC-type), with the conventional hexagonal structure (H-type). CFRCLS samples are fabricated using fused filament fabrication (FFF), with carbon-fiber-reinforced polylactic acid (PLA) as the matrix. The in-plane compression properties, energy absorption characteristics, and deformation behaviors of the hybrid structures were studied by experimental tests. The results demonstrate that different permutation and hybrid modes alter the deformation behaviors and mechanical properties of the structures. Taking elastic modulus as an example, the values of H-type, R-type, OOA-type, OHA-type, ONA-type, and RC-type are, respectively, 6.08 MPa, 5.76 MPa, 19.0 MPa, 10.3 MPa, 31.7 MPa, and 73.2 MPa, while the ratio of their masses is 1:1:1.10:1.52:1.66. Furthermore, hybrid lattice structures exhibit significantly improved mechanical properties compared to single lattice structures. Compared to the single structure R-type, the RC-type increases elastic modulus, yield strength, and energy absorption, respectively, by 12.7 times, 5.4 times, and 4.4 times. © 2024 by the authors.","continuous carbon-fiber-reinforced composite; hybrid lattice structures; multiple permutations; path arrangement","Energy absorption; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Geometry; Honeycomb structures; Structural properties; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Composite lattices; Continuous carbon-fiber-reinforced composite; Continuous fibers; Fibre-reinforced composite; Hybrid lattice; Hybrid lattice structure; Lattice structures; Multiple permutation; Path arrangement; Elastic moduli","L.

However, the retaining sleeve may enlarge the thickness of equivalent air-gap, resulting in a decrease in motor performance. To solve this problem, a 1. 1 MW, 18 000 r / min interior permanent magnet synchronous motor with a novel rotor topology was designed. In the structure the permanent magnet segment design was adopted, and the strengthening rib was added to disperse the stress at the magnetic bridge, so that the thickness of the retaining sleeve can be effectively reduced. At the same time, the external magnetic bridge was replaced with non-magnetic fillers to block the magnetic leakage path, so as to improve the utilization of permanent magnet. Finally, the finite element method analysis results show that compared with the initial model, under the condition of the equivalent air-gap of the novel structure motor is increased by 1. 5 mm, the output torque reaches 600. 44 N·m, an increase of 16. 86 N·m. In the meanwhile, the maximum stress of the novel rotor is reduced by 496. 82 MPa, the rotor mechanical strength of the novel structure motor is significantly improved, which can provide reference for the rotor topology design of high-power and high-speed permanent magnet motors. © 2024 Editorial Department of Electric Machines and Control.

However, current vitrimers have not yet reached the level of commercial epoxy resins, especially in performance and preparation process. In this study, high-performance epoxy vitrimer has been prepared using a commercial epoxy-anhydride. In the presence of 1,5,7-triazabicyclo[4.4.0]dec-5-ene (TBD) as an internal catalyst, both mechanical and thermal properties were improved significantly because of the complete curing reaction facilitated by TBD. With the addition of catalyst TBD, the tensile strength, modulus, elongation at break and the glass transition temperature (Tg) of materials increased from 49.12 to 79.27 MPa, 2080.96 to 2266.19 MPa, 2.78% to 3.86%, and 94°C to 132°C respectively. Meanwhile, the network rearrangement rate improved, in which the stress relaxation time (τ*) of networks declined from 19 min to 10 min at 200°C. Taking advantages of dynamic properties, these vitrimers can be reshaped and chemically degraded. Furthermore, carbon fiber composites are fabricated by using vitrimer as matrix, which can be successfully recycled with chemical degradation process at 160°C within 1 h. This research facilitates the development of recyclable epoxy and composites that exhibits significant potential for commercial applications.

Here, a method utilizing non-covalent supramolecular interactions and synergistic hyperbranched structures is reported to endow transesterification-based thermosetting materials with recyclability in the absence of a catalyst. A hyperbranched epoxy resin curing agent (HPCA) containing amide bonds, terminated by amine and ester, was designed and synthesized, and further cured with bisphenol A epoxy resin. The hyperbranched topological structure and its abundant amide bonds contribute to the formation of a dense hydrogen bonding network, enhancing the reprocessability, thermal, and mechanical properties of the material. As a result, the resin can be reprocessed by hot pressing at 190 °C and 10 MPa for 40 min without catalyst. Moreover, amide and ester bonds endow resin materials with excellent degradation performance in alkaline solutions, laying the foundation for the recycling and utilization of carbon fibers in composite materials. © 2024","Dynamic covalent bond; Hyperbranch; Non-covalent interaction; Recycling","","Y.

However, erosion behaviours and associated wear mechanisms of the composites may be influenced by the fibre structures due to heterogeneous composition and complex architectural topologies. Understanding the erosive mechanisms of the structured composites can be important, not only for preventing surface damage and loss of mechanical strength but also for improving design and fabrication of the composites. This paper presents an experimental study of erosive wear under sand blasting on 3D woven carbon-fibre-reinforced textile composites with epoxy. The architectural topology methods of the composites include non-crimped bidirectional, tufted bidirectional, 3D layer-to-layer and 3D orthogonal textile methods. The erosion tests were conducted on four impact angles (20°, 30°, 45° and 90°) under one impact velocity at 40 m/s. The study results show that the erosive mechanism of the textile composites is different from that of the neat substrate material. The observations from this study also reveal the different erosive behaviours between the composites with different fibre structures.

Star strategies via dynamic cross-linking hydrogen bonds and/or covalent bonds can afford reprocessable thermosets, but often at the cost of properties or even their functions. Herein, a simple strategy coined as hyperbranched dynamic crosslinking networks (HDCNs) toward in-practice engineering a petroleum-based epoxy thermoset into degradable, reconfigurable, and multifunctional vitrimer is provided. The special characteristics of HDCNs involve spatially topological crosslinks for solvent adaption and multi-dynamic linkages for reversible behaviors. The resulting vitrimer displays mild room-temperature degradation to dimethylacetamide and can realize the cycling of carbon fiber and epoxy powder from composite. Besides, they have supra toughness and high flexural modulus, high transparency as well as fire-retardancy surpassing their original thermoset. Notably, it is noted in a chance-following that ethanol molecule can induce the reconstruction of vitrimer network by ester-exchange, converting a stiff vitrimer into elastomeric feature, and such material records an ultrahigh modulus (5.45 GPa) at −150 °C for their ultralow-temperature condition uses. This is shaping up to be a potentially sustainable advanced material to address the post-consumer thermoset waste, and also provide a newly crosslinked mode for the designs of high-performance polymer. © 2023 The Authors.

Recent advancements in CF technology have reduced production costs, enhancing market growth. Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites offer benefits such as fatigue resistance, weight reduction, stiffness, and corrosion resistance. The choice of matrix material, particularly thermoplastics, impacts CFRP properties, with thermoplastics favored for recyclability and mass production. Fabrication techniques like filament winding and resin transfer molding ensure precise CF alignment but have complexities. Additive manufacturing (AM) methods, such as FDM, DLP, and SLA, provide design flexibility and efficiency. Recycling approaches, including thermal, mechanical, and chemical methods, address CFRP waste.

The first strategy is based on designing the blade through the selection of the beam material. Aluminium and aluminium foam with different porosity levels are considered for the beam material. The moduli of elasticity of the foams were calculated using the Mori-Tanaka approach and ranged from 70 GPa for solid aluminium to 23.3 GPa for foams with 50% porosity. Then, using these results, the finite element simulations under various loading conditions are performed. It is observed that increasing the foam porosity from 0% to 50% results in a 50% reduction in beam weight, with only a 35% decrease in the specific stiffness. The second strategy involves a topology optimisation of the internal beam to determine the most structurally efficient geometry for the blade through finite element analyses. Aluminium is considered the beam material for topology optimisation studies. The topology optimisation leads to a 53% reduction in the beam mass compared to the initial design, while maintaining performance metrics within acceptable limits. The mechanical behaviour of blades designed with these two strategies is investigated in eight different positions during a complete revolution in steady-state. The results are compared to each other, as well as a blade with a balsa beam as a benchmark. By providing a comprehensive assessment and comparison, this study provides a better understanding of how the chosen design method affects blade performance and demonstrates the balance between weight reduction and structural efficiency. © 2025 The Author(s).

The finite element model and optimization model of carbon fiber composite integrated traction beam are constructed to explore the optimal distribution of materials in the design space to complete the topology optimization by taking the minimum compliance and the minimum mass fraction as the objective function, and the maximum volume fraction and the maximum displacement as the optimization constraints, respectively. Geometric reconstruction of the traction beam based on optimal results shows better iteration results using max displacement as the optimization objective.

Nevertheless, due to the highly planar D4h symmetry configuration in M-N4, their adsorption behavior toward oxygen intermediates is limited, undesirably elevating the energy barriers associated with ORR. Moreover, the structural engineering of the carbon substrate also poses significant challenges. Herein, inspired by the biological neural network (BNN), a reticular nervous system for high-speed signal processing and transmitting, a comprehensive structural biomimetic strategy is proposed for tailoring Fe-N4 single atoms (Fe SAs) coupled with Fe atomic clusters (Fe ACs) active sites, which are anchored onto chitosan microfibers/nanofibers-based carbon aerogel (CMNCA-FeSA+AC) with continuous conductive channels and an oriented porous architecture.

Here, monolithic carbon fibers are prepared with single atomic Ni sites directly from bulk metal. The synchronous support growth and metal diffusion realizes the effective atomization of nickel foam, and the innovative strategy of topological growth within a confined space results in robust and tough monolith.

However, the use of continuous slit tapes along component lengths generates significant waste. This waste presents an opportunity for recycling into secondary load-bearing structures, particularly in applications where components are not subjected to extreme working conditions. In this study, carbon fiber-reinforced polyetherketoneketone (CF/PEKK) strands are recycled into randomly oriented strand (ROS) panels using a cost-effective, vacuum-assisted hot press process while maintaining aerospace-quality standards. Both long and short strand lengths, as well as shredded strands mimicking real-life industrial waste, are analyzed for their mechanical performance and geometric stability. Mechanical properties of the recycled CF/PEKK composites are evaluated through tensile, shear, compression, Izod impact, and dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA), using digital image correlation (DIC) for precise measurements. Additionally, topological 3D scanning is used to assess the geometric stability of the panels. Results indicate that short strands offer superior mechanical properties, while shredded strands perform comparably. This study makes a unique contribution by demonstrating the effective recycling of slit tape waste into high-performance composite materials, advancing sustainable practices in aerospace applications. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","CF/PEKK; Digital image correlation; Mechanical properties; Randomly oriented strand (ROS); Recycling; Reuse","Aerospace industry; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Convergence of numerical methods; Hydroelasticity; Carbon fiber reinforced; Carbon fiber-reinforced polyetherketoneketone; Digital image correlations; Mechanical; Mechanical performance; Property; Randomly oriented strand; Recycled carbon fibres; Reuse; Secondary loads","H.S.

This paper presents MoonFiber, a project derived from a competition designed by Young Architects Competition (YAC) for the construction of a settlement located in a lunar lava tube. This choice is determined by the need to exploit a place with characteristics suitable for human permanence in the long term, achieving a balance between safety and construction complexity. The Moon is a hostile environment, seemingly devoid of blatant resources, subject to the most destructive events in the solar system, such as the constant bombardment of both micrometeorites and radiation, as well as occasional solar storms. The project finds full realization, in its working and living functional divisions, below the lunar surface, while the areas used for ISRU, 3D printing, payload unloading, and energy production operations are located near the entrance of the lava tube, to which they connect via a main logistic axis. The main structure, built in the lava tube, is made up of a series of inflatable modules held suspended in the center of the gallery by a mesh of composite material fibers obtained through extrusion and winding of regolith fiber. The weaving technique of the supporting structure becomes the turning point regarding the architectural composition of the settlement because it makes everything light and parameterized based on the morphology of the place, which is subject to an automated preliminary scan by robots performing as an avant-garde fleet, extrapolating the optimized topology underlying the definition of the framework of the system. This structure is initially defined by its anchorages to the lava tube walls, to which the upper and lower load-bearing fibers are connected, on which rests a mesh, also in fiber, which performs the function of a suspended base for the inflatable modules. The construction technique is based on the processing of the fiber filament. The goal is to obtain the filament from the lunar regolith, adaptable in composition with different quantities and types of yarn, from glass to carbon fiber; the production process of such coils of fiber is described in detail in this paper, along with its installation in a notional lava tube. © ASCE.","","Electric towers; Extrusion; Glass fibers; Inflatable equipment; Lunar surface analysis; Moon bases; Mortar; Textile processing; Water towers; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; ARTEMIS; Composite fibres; Construction complexity; Energy productions; Functionals; Hostile environments; Lunar surface; Solar storms; Filament winding","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207862479"

FFF is well-suited for optimization methods, as designers can specifically tailor the positioning of CCF filaments, albeit within certain manufacturing limitations. This study integrates experiments and finite element analysis (FEA) to investigate strength-based optimization methods applied to two benchmark structural domains and loading scenarios. Two methods were used to concurrently design the shape or topology and fiber paths: shape optimization using the level-set method, and topology optimization using both density-based solid orthotropic material with penalization (SOMP) and level-set methods. CCF filaments were printed to follow the optimized fiber paths, and a discontinuous fiber reinforced filament was used to fill in the remaining gaps. The parts were then compression molded for full consolidation, followed by testing for their stiffness and failure loads. FEA predicted locations and magnitudes of failure with reasonable accuracy, even in regions with complex stress states and fiber paths. X-ray micro-computed tomography (µCT) examination of failed coupons showed that fiber flow (deviations) during compression molding occurred and impacted parts’ performance. Finally, comparing designs optimized for stiffness versus strength showed premature failures due to stress concentrations in stiffness-optimized designs. This study underscores the critical need for integrating proper optimization strategies with realistic AM constraints and processing-induced defects to enhance the performance and reliability of CCF reinforced AM parts. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Continuous fiber; Design; Failure; Finite element analysis (FEA); Topology optimization","3D printing; Additives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Compression molding; Computerized tomography; Design; Failure (mechanical); Finite element method; Level measurement; Numerical methods; Stiffness; Topology; Carbon fiber reinforced; Continuous fibers; Experimental investigations; Experimental validations; Fiber path; Finite element analyse; Level Set method; Optimization method; Topology optimisation; Shape optimization","M.

Given the core position of the main mirror in the performance of the camera, achieving its dual optimization design of high precision and lightweight has become the key technical bottleneck and breakthrough point for promoting the innovation of space camera technology and ensuring the efficient and stable operation of the camera in the extreme space environment. In this paper, the SiC material with high specific stiffness and excellent thermal conductivity is selected as the mirror body material, and the flat back open structure and triangular lightweight holes are adopted. The weight is successfully reduced to 6.7 kg, and the lightweight ratio exceeds 70%, which realizes the structural strengthening and thermal stability improvement of the Φ480mm aperture primary mirror. Additionally, to address the challenge of imaging stability for large-aperture and long-focal-length cameras, this paper designs the support structure of the carbon fiber load-bearing tower for the primary and secondary mirrors and adjusts the support structure based on the topological optimization results to ensure stable connection and support between the primary and secondary mirrors and effectively resist the influence of space environment changes on imaging quality. To verify the scientificity and practicability of the design scheme, finite element simulation analysis is conducted to verify the analysis and optimization. The static analysis results indicate that the total rigid body displacement of the mirror assembly meets the requirements. The modal analysis verifies that the first-order natural frequency of the entire structure of the camera's primary and secondary mirrors is 142.76 Hz, which satisfies the stiffness requirements. The sinusoidal and random vibration analysis shows that the maximum stress generated by each component is small. The above analysis verifies that the mirror and its supporting structure meet the stiffness and strength requirements and possess good dynamic performance. The design scheme can fulfill the strict optical design requirements of space astronomical cameras and lays a solid foundation for enhancing the overall performance of space cameras. © 2024 SPIE.","Finite element analysis; Lightweight design; Primary and secondary mirror support structure; SiC mirror; Space camera","Compaction; Intellectual property core; Optical design; Process control; Rigid structures; Shape optimization; Structural analysis; Structural dynamics; Vibration analysis; Finite element analyse; Lightweight design; Mirror supports; Primary and secondary mirror support structure; Primary mirrors; Secondary mirror; SiC mirrors; Space cameras; Support structures; Thermal; Mirrors","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85210878613"

To optimize their performance in high-demand environments, surface functionalization of vitrimers and vitrimeric composites is crucial to enhance their durability and reliability in harsh conditions. This research work aims at studying the feasibility of metallising vitrimer-based components through cold spray technology. Aluminium coatings were applied under varying process parameters, inlet gas temperature (T = 150 –450 °C) and standoff distance (SoD = 70 mm–100 mm), to evaluate their impact on deposition quality and substrate behaviour. The deposition processes were performed on non-reinforced vitrimeric substrates as well as on vitrimeric matrix substrates reinforced with carbon fibre fabric. The results suggest that successful metallization occurs when the substrate temperature exceeds the topology freezing transition temperature (Tv ≈ 170 °C), enabling the ductile behaviour necessary for effective adhesion. At T = 300 °C and SoD = 100 mm, pure vitrimer coatings exhibited an average thickness of 50 ± 10 µm with minimal substrate deformation (grooves < 4% of panel thickness), while lower temperatures (T = 150 °C) resulted in brittle fracture and poor adhesion. Surface roughness increased from Sa = 0.15 ± 0.05 µm for uncoated substrates to Sa = 6.59 µm after coating. In contrast, composite substrates demonstrated enhanced stability due to fibre reinforcement, which constrained excessive substrate flow. At the best process conditions (T = 300 °C and SoD = 100 mm), composite panels achieved homogeneous coatings with Sa = 4.513 µm. However, excessive temperatures (T = 450 °C) led to substrate erosion and fibre damage in both pure vitrimer and composite panels. © The Author(s) 2025.","coatings; cold spray; composites; inorganic; polymer matrix; vitrimers","Aluminum coatings; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Ductile fracture; Elastomers; Laser cladding; Metallizing; Silicones; Thermosets; Cold spray; Cold spray techniques; Composite panels; Epoxy; Inorganics; Mechanical; Polymer matrices; Reprocessability; Technological applications; Vitrimer; Brittle fracture","A.S.

Inspired by natural biological structures, this work introduces bamboo fiber ferrite into a bionic medium-carbon steel through warm rolling and short-time annealing. The resulting cementite presents multi-scale features spanning from tens of nanometers to hundreds of nanometers. The bionic steel has the characteristics of mitigating micro and macro local stress concentration, the yield strength achieves ∼800 MPa, which is ∼3 times that of conventional carbon steel, while maintaining excellent ductility (21.7 %). Extensive investigation reveals that the microscopic stress relief stems from hetero-deformation induced hardening and point-line topological stress transfer. Analysis of the fracture and the microstructures at crack tips indicates that the spherical cementite disperses the stress at the crack tip, making it difficult for cracks to expand, and mitigating macroscopic stress concentration.

Design/methodology/approach: The variable thickness sheet (VTS) method is used to obtain a free material distribution under the specified volume constraint. The anisotropic equivalent stiffness matrix based on the material fiber angles is considered in the orthotropic material properties model, which ensures a sufficiently large design space to minimize the frequency response. To lessen the computational burden, the quasi-static Ritz vector (QSRV) method is integrated to approximate the structural response. Findings: Compared to considering only one element, the optimization process simultaneously considers the spatially-varying fiber angles and the material distribution, allowing for a broader design space to minimize the frequency response of additive manufacturing (AM) structures. The orthotropic properties play an important role in determining optimal material distribution of the structure. Moreover, the QSRV method makes the frequency response analysis more efficient.

However, the extraction of uniform thickness shell in a topology optimization process as well as fabricated by carbon fiber reinforced plastic is still challenge. This paper proposed a integration framework on the design and manufacturing of the topology optimized structure with rigid shell and foam filled. A modified non-monotonic function is carried out to interpolate the border coat and the infill foam, directly extract an unique coat from the single material topology optimization process. The sensitivities analyze the non-monotonic interpolation, objective and constraint considered in the optimization procedure. With this interpolation and control subsequent, we come up with a dual-molding method to fabricate the optimized structure with topology layout, rigid shell and foam infill. We compare the stiffness performance of the composite with the single material topology optimization result to discover the improvement of proposed method. The result apply to the laser altimeter sensor bracket of unmanned helicopter with high load bearing stiffness and limited design area.

In this work, we used l-cystine dimethyl ester (CDE), a disulfide-containing diamine, as the hardener to synthesize a type of EP vitrimer, EPV-CDE. The tensile strength of EPV-CDE reached 81.5 MPa mainly due to the relatively short chains of the CDE hardener and resulting high cross-linking density, and at the same time, EPV-CDE was able to be recycled under a mild temperature at 120 °C, with a 93.4% recovery ratio after the first recycling cycle, enabled by the relatively flexible chains and low steric hindrance of the CDE hardener. Compared to most of disulfide-containing EP vitrimers reported in the literature, EPV-CDE demonstrated higher tensile strength and lower activation energy and topology freezing transition temperature. Moreover, the liquid nature of CDE allows the incorporation of up to 25 wt % carbon fiber powder into the EPV-CDE matrix to prepare the EPV-CDE/CF composite, which achieved the tensile strength of 112.5 MPa and maintained excellent recyclability. Even though our EP vitrimer exhibited strong resistance performance to most solvents, it could also be chemically degraded by thiol-containing solvents such as dithiothreitol, offering environmental-friendly substitutes for unsustainable thermoset resins. © 2024 American Chemical Society.","disulfide bonds; epoxy vitrimer; high strength; mild healing temperature; multirecyclable; rapid stress relaxation","Bond strength (chemical); Covalent bonds; Crosslinking; Elastomers; Recycling; Tensile strength; Thermosets; Dimethyl esters; Disulphide bonds; Epoxy; Epoxy vitrimer; Healing temperature; High-strength; L-cystine; Mild healing temperature; Multirecyclable; Rapid stress relaxation; Activation energy","S.

The introduction of symbiotic carbon components with varying dimensional structures and graphitization degree contributes to regulating the growth environment and electromagnetic response modes of bimetallic MOFs. In this work, the intelligent regulation of the electromagnetic wave absorption band was achieved by incorporating NiCo-MOF into 1D carbon fibers and 3D alginate-derived carbon networks, with a particular focus on addressing urgent low-frequency electromagnetic pollution. Notably, under appropriate ratios of carbon components and NiCo-MOF, NiCo-MOF@C-α exhibited an RLmin of −41.23 dB at 4.96 GHz with a matching thickness of 3.0 mm, while NiCo-MOF@C-β showed an RLmin of −53.25 dB at 8.72 GHz with a matching thickness of 2.5 mm. The realization of the band-modulation function in high-performance bimetallic MOF-based electromagnetic wave absorbers was attributed to the balance and optimization of impedance matching and attenuation constants, facilitated by interface construction and defect engineering. This work provides new insights and strategies for the development of switchable low/mid-band electromagnetic wave absorption materials and contributes to the advancement of non-carbonized bimetallic MOFs for electromagnetic devices. © 2025 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Carbon capture; Carbon cycle; Electric insulating materials; Layered semiconductors; alginic acid; carbon; carbon fiber; metal organic framework; Bimetallics; Carbonization process; Electromagnetic response; Electromagnetic wave absorber; Electromagnetics; Intelligent switching; Matchings; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Symbiotics; Wave absorption; absorption; Article; carbonization; controlled study; electromagnetic radiation; human; impedance; pharmaceutics; thickness; Carbon fibers","S.

This current study provides new insights towards the development of self-lubricating systems by material and topological design, systems which tend to exhibit near-superlubric tribological performance, by reporting the synergistic effect of selective surface patterning and presence of carbon micro/nano-fillers on the frictional coefficients of additively manufactured structures. Geometric and biomimetic surface patterns were prepared by fused deposition modelling (FDM), using printing filaments of a polymeric matrix infused with graphene nanoplatelets (GNPs) and carbon fibers (Cf). The calorimetric, spectroscopic, mechanical and optical microscopy characterization of the starting materials and as-printed structures provided fundamental insights for their tribological characterization under a ball-on-disk configuration. In geometrically patterned PLA-based structures, a graphene presence reduced the friction coefficient by ca. 8%, whereas PETG exhibited the lowest coefficients, in the vicinity of 0.1, indicating a high supelubric potential. Biomimetic patterns exhibited an inferior frictional response due to their topologically and tribologically anisotropy of the surfaces. Overall, a graphene presence in the starting materials demonstrated great potential for friction reduction, while PETG showed a tribological performance not only superior to PLA, but also compatible with superlubric performance.

Herein, we employed Ni-MOFs as a precursor, induced its topological deformation in the presence of graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets, and finally harvested composite aerogels composed of GO nanosheets and Ni-MOF fibers. It was found that GO nanosheets can resist the thermal shrinkage of composite aerogels during high-temperature pyrolysis and endow the resulting Ni/C@rGO composite aerogels (NCGCAs) with very high porosity (96.4%) and extremely low density (0.04 g cm−3). Electromagnetic analyses revealed that changes in structure and composition effectively reinforce the overall loss capability of NCGCAs, and thus generate obvious improvements in broadband response with a thin thickness (12.8-18.0 GHz, 1.5 mm). The good EM absorption performance of NCGCAs is significantly superior to those of many reported Ni/C aerogels. In addition, the structural advantage of NCGCAs demonstrates their potential application in thermal management. This GO-mediated MOF deformation is a promising strategy for the formation of high-porosity magnetic metal/carbon composite aerogels, which may bring some unexpected benefits in different fields. © 2024 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Energy utilization; Functional materials; Graphene; Heat conduction; Porosity; Temperature control; Topology; Carbon composites; Composite aerogel; Electromagnetics; Energy-consumption; Graphene oxide nanosheet; Graphene oxides; High porosity; Magnetic metals; Structural advantage; Topological deformation; Aerogels","X.

In the first case, the mechanical properties of cubic structures using Polylactic Acid (PLA) is predicted and validated through simulations and experiments with different lattices. The typical lattices include triangular and square. The results indicate that the triangular lattice pattern exhibits superior mechanical properties compared to the other patterns. The second case study entails the evaluation of the ASTM D638 model subjected to tension forces, incorporating distinct lattice designs along with CCF reinforcement. This investigation provides valuable insights into selecting optimal infill patterns and effectively combining CCF reinforcement with PLA resin.

This study aims to predict fabric on arbitrary mandrels based on the yarn interactions, especially for mandrels with flat surfaces. An interaction yarn deposition model is proposed to simulate the process of braiding arbitrary-shaped mandrels. A dynamic deposition model is established at the moment of deposition, and a quasi-static equilibrium equation is added to determine the spatial position of yarn interaction points. Post-processing of positional information is performed to obtain the yarn spatial arrangement on the mandrel’s surface. Experiments were conducted using Zhongfu Shenying 12K T700 carbon yarn and Yunlu Composite 176-carrier radial braiding equipment.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and review of the challenges associated with enhancing mechanical properties stemming from interfacial bonding issues and pore defects in 3D-printed CCFRTP parts. Specifically, this study thoroughly examines the properties and modification techniques pertinent to two critical constituents of printing materials: the resin matrix and carbon fiber reinforcement. It also explores advancements in FFF printing equipment specifically designed for CCFRTP components, alongside current developments in related impregnation processes. Furthermore, this work introduces an evolution in continuum path planning grounded in principles of structural lightweight design while applying topology optimization to create anisotropic CCFRTP structures. The influence of various printing process parameters on mechanical properties is analyzed systematically; additionally, processing strategies that incorporate auxiliary reinforcement techniques—such as thermopressure, negative pressure, laser application, magnetic fields, microwave energy, and infrared radiation—are emphasized. The mechanical behavior is meticulously tracked throughout the study, while corresponding failure mechanisms are scrutinized through recent advancements in characterization methods aimed at visualizing void defects. We critically assess the existing technological challenges that impede the 3D printing of CCFRTPs and propose potential future research directions intended to inspire further exploration within this promising field. Highlights: Optimizing the CCFRTP interface hinges on material matching and synergistic CCF mods. CF continuity and anisotropy demand refined print/impregnation design and algorithm. Stress-guided path planning with topo optimization unveils innovative potential.

To address this issue, a novel methodology for the fabrication of fused deposition modeling (FDM) components with continuous carbon fibers aligned in the building direction has been developed. This approach involves embedding continuous carbon fibers into the print path through mechanical traction, enabling the fabrication of complex-shaped reinforcements. Tensile testing revealed that the incorporation of carbon fibers at a volume fraction of 5.8% significantly enhanced the Z-direction strength of the specimens by 449%. Furthermore, the maximum fracture strain observed was 1611.7% greater than that of the control group, and the elastic modulus increased to 381% of its original value. The study also investigated the mechanism of enhancement and fracture, observing transitions from brittle to ductile fracture with increasing fiber content. The proposed method was demonstrated through the fabrication of a continuous fiber-reinforced butterfly arch bridge model specimen, which exhibited a 120.5% increase in load-bearing capacity compared to the unreinforced specimen in three-point bending tests. This methodology offers a promising solution for enhancing the Z-direction strength of 3D-printed PLA components, enabling their application in load-bearing structures. Highlights: Employing continuous fiber to enhance FDM Z-direction strength. Tensile strength, maximum fracture strain, and elastic modulus in the Z-direction increased by 449%, 1611.7%, and 381%, respectively. Increasing Z-direction fiber content induces a transition from brittle interlayer bond failure to ductile tearing.

In the present work, we constructed the microscopic topology and interfacial structure of the fiber structure based on the homogenization of finite elements and molecular dynamics theory. For the anisotropy of fiber thermal conductivity, we proposed an anisotropic cross-scale heat transport model for carbon fiber/epoxy resin (CF/ER) composites, with consideration of interfacial thermal resistance (ITR). Based on the numerical validation of the reliability of the method, we established a dual coordinate system to analyze the mechanism of the geometric topological parameters on the structural anisotropic heat transport. The fiber volume fraction significantly affected the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) within a range of 10% to 15%, with ETC growth rates of up to 50%. The fiber orientation angle influenced the main heat transfer direction, and when the fiber volume fraction was 40%, increasing the fiber orientation angle to 90° could enhance the ETC in the axial direction up to 130.28%. Meanwhile, the larger orientation angle could reduce the interfacial phonon heat dissipation and achieve the better phonon transmission effect. The change of fiber structure could effectively modulate the ETC, while the fiber length and cross-sectional shape would have less effect on the ETC. With the introduction of fiber tortuosity, the heat transport could be regulated by changing the tortuosity. Within the variation range of tortuosity from 1 to 3, the ETC regulation of the composite could be achieved from 12% to 42% in the axial direction and 14% to 34% in the radial direction. With increasing curvature, the ETC variation trend became gradually nonlinear. The study serves as a theoretical basis for the preparation and thermal properties evaluation of fiber-reinforced composites. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Composite materials; Dual coordinate system; Effective thermal conductivity; Interfacial thermal resistance; Structural parameters","Anisotropy; Carbon fibers; Fiber reinforced plastics; Heat resistance; Heat transfer; Molecular dynamics; Numerical methods; Thermal conductivity; Volume fraction; Co-ordinate system; Composites material; Dual coordinate system; Effective thermal conductivity; Fiber orientation angle; Fiber volume fractions; Fibre structure; Heat transport; Interfacial thermal resistance; Structural parameter; Topology","Q.

Panels made from virgin glycol-modified polyethylene terephthalate (PETG) and its carbon fiber-reinforced composite (PETG/CF) were produced using Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) technology, with a Raise3D E2 printer. Tensile tests were performed on these specimens, focusing on different printing orientations, revealing that orientation significantly influences Young's modulus and tensile yield strength. Subsequently, low-velocity drop-weight impact tests were conducted on the panels at impact velocities of 1.5m⋅s−1and 2.5m⋅s−1 to assess impact energy and damage patterns. The ABAQUS/Explicit software was used to model the sandwich panels' behavior, incorporating the elasto-plastic properties of PETG and PETG/CF derived from tensile test data. Two types of topological honeycomb cores auxetic and hexagonal were analyzed. The study found that the auxetic honeycomb structure better resists impact, showing superior impact behavior compared to the hexagonal structure, which is more sensitive to impact.

This implies that environmental stimuli must remain consistent and predictable throughout their journey to our sensory organs. When it comes to vision, electromagnetic waves are minimally affected when passing through air or glass treated for chromatic aberrations. Similar conclusions can be drawn for hearing and acoustic waves. However, tools that propagate elastic waves to our cutaneous afferents tend to color tactual perception due to parasitic mechanical attributes such as resonances and inertia. These issues are often overlooked, despite their critical importance for haptic devices that aim to faithfully render or record tactile interactions. Here, we investigate how to optimize this mechanical transmission with sandwich structures made from rigid, lightweight carbon fiber sheets arranged around a 3D-printed lattice core. Through a comprehensive parametric evaluation, we demonstrate how this design paradigm provides superior haptic transparency, regardless of the lattice types. Drawing an analogy with topology optimization, our solution approaches a foreseeable technological limit. It offers a practical way to create high-fidelity haptic interfaces, opening new avenues for research on tool-mediated interactions. © 2008-2011 IEEE.","Haptic transparency; lattice; sandwich structure","Carbon Fiber; Equipment Design; Humans; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Touch; Touch Perception; User-Computer Interface; Acoustic impedance; Audition; Crystal lattices; Haptic interfaces; Honeycomb structures; Mice (computer peripherals); Rigid structures; Shape optimization; carbon fiber; Environmental stimuli; Face; Haptic transparencies; Haptics interfaces; Lattice; Multimodal perception; Sensory organs; Surface impedances; Topological structure; computer interface; equipment design; human; physiology; three dimensional printing; touch; Sandwich structures","T.

In this study, a series of carbon fiber-based Co/MnO nanocomposites is derived from Co/Mn bimetal Prussian blue analogs encapsulated in polymer nanofiber networks by electrospinning. It has been demonstrated that various topological shapes can be modulated by modulating surfactants, thereby changing the degree of graphitization and electrical conductivity. The optimized spherical precursor composite carbon fiber exhibits superior EMW absorption capability with minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of −58.15 dB with a thickness of 2.3 mm. Moreover, ultrabroad effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) as large as 8.96 GHz is obtained.

Although hybrid components provide a combination of the advantages of the constituent materials, there are some challenges for the manufacture of high-quality hybrid components, including potentially weak interfacial bonding between the constituent materials. This paper presents a study focused on enhancing the interfacial strength of hybrid components by using additive manufacturing (AM) to manipulate the surface topology of a substrate component. Specifically, the study involved conducting experiments on a polyamide/CFRP hybrid component in which the PA12 substrates were manufactured with a controlled surface topology using polymer powder bed fusion. The mechanical testing study revealed several key findings, including an increase in bonding strength by modifying the substrate surface features, and significant improvements in out-of-plane interlaminar bonding strength by adding substrate surface features such as pins or fluorite lattices. It is shown that normal strength was enhanced by up to 53% between the substrate and pure epoxy, and by 126% between the substrate and a CFRP laminate. These results highlight the potential benefits of using AM technologies to enhance the interfacial strength of hybrid components and suggest directions for future research in this area. © The Author(s) 2024.","Additive manufacturing; CFRP; Hybrid composites; Interfacial strength","3D printing; Additives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Hybrid materials; Mechanical testing; Topology; Bonding strength; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Constituent materials; Hybrid component; Hybrid composites; Interfacial strength; Substrate surface; Surface feature; Surface topology; Topology modifications; Substrates","H.

However, constructing fully biobased dynamic cross-linking networks that integrate mechanical, reprocessability, and degradability remains a significant challenge. In this work, a fully biobased epoxy vitrimer with a disulfide bond-decorated dynamic covalent network was developed using biomass-derived diphenolic acid and cystamine. Diphenolic acid underwent an amidation reaction with cystamine, followed by epoxidation to form an epoxy monomer, which was further cured with cystamine to obtain fully biobased epoxy vitrimers. The as-prepared epoxy vitrimers exhibited excellent mechanical properties and thermal stability, attributed to the high cross-linking density and topological interlocking structure induced by amidation. The dynamic cross-linking network endowed the epoxy vitrimers with good self-healing and reprocessability through disulfide bond exchange reactions, while the disulfide bonds could enable degradability when treated with dithiothreitol. When epoxy vitrimers were used as a matrix to form carbon fiber-reinforced composites, the obtained composites exhibited a tensile strength exceeding 613.53 MPa. The resin matrix could be completely degraded in 2.5 h without compromising the structure or properties of the carbon fibers.

The dual-phase material is defined as a carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) considering the low-weight requirements in aerospace applications. Additive manufacturing techniques allow the design flexibility for these materials to generate complicated topologies with enhanced mechanical performance. In the dual-phase composite, the optimal fiber locations are determined by minimizing the high stress/strain concentrations under complex loading involving tension and shear. On the other hand, the porous structure, which only includes the matrix polymer (i.e., without fibers), is studied to find the optimal locations of circular voids by minimizing the high stress/strain concentrations over the design domain. The locations of fibers and voids are randomly sampled to generate 450 geometries for each case, and the finite element method (FEM) is applied to these samples to create training and test data for a deep learning model. The main objective of the optimization is defined as the minimization of the energy fraction (Ef), which is selected as a metric of high stress/strain concentrations as it refers to the ratio of the strain energy density (We) of finite elements to the total strain energy density (Wtotal). The strain energy density function is formulated considering both tensile and shear force effects. The designs providing the minimum value of the maximum and average energy fractions are identified by integrating the optimization into the deep learning model. © 2025, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

This study aims to develop a novel strength-based collaborative optimization of topological layout and fiber path (namely SCOTF) for continuous fiber reinforced composite structures through a level set algorithm with a parameterized stream function. The level set function for characterizing structural topology and the stream function for portraying fiber path are decomposed into a sum of weights associated with a series of radial basis functions. In this approach, the weights are treated as design variables to update the topological layout and fiber path of CFRP structure. To enhance mechanical strength, the design objective is established in terms of the Tsai-Wu strength criterion with mathematical derivation of analytical sensitivity. The effectiveness and reliability of SCOTF are demonstrated by three illustrative examples to compare with other two conventional methods, namely a maximum principal stress-based fiber placement and a stiffness-based design. In comparison, the structural strength optimized by SCOTF increase by 28.9 % and 42.8 %, respectively, proving that SCOTF can generate more effective topological layouts with smooth and continuous fiber paths, appreciably alleviating the concentration of failure index and lowering damage and failure of CFRP composite structures.

The composite sandwich structures for different dual-phase strengthening strategies are designed, where the topology optimization is used to yield efficient lattice distribution configurations. The experimental samples are fabricated by 3D-printing and three-point bending tests are conducted. The flexural failure process and failure modes are observed and analyzed to reveal the failure mechanisms. Results show that DPL-1-CFRP and DPL-2-CFRP have higher peak load (+24.8 % and 18.0 %), post-peak average load (42.6 % and 20.8 %) and specific energy absorption (+7.8 % and + 21.1 %) compared to SPL-1-CFRP. It is indicated that the interactive failure mechanism of dual-phase lattice is effective in improving the mechanical properties of sandwich structure. It represents the occurrence of synergistic deformation between struts rather than a single brittle fracture. Finally, several potential failure mechanisms for the separation of the core and end faces are revealed.

The kerf structures, which consist of top and bottom cells linked by connectors and gaps between cells, enable the construction of freeform geometries. The kerf topology can lead to structural reconfigurations, i.e., connector buckling and densification, under compression and locking mechanism under bending, which contributes to energy absorption and alters stiffness and load bearing of kerf structures as they deform. We investigate the compressive and bending responses of 3D-printed kerf structures through experiments and simulations. We consider two kerf topologies, namely hexagon-triangle and square patterns, printed out of brittle Polylactic Acid (PLA), compliant thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU), and ductile Onyx composite consisting of nylon and carbon fiber. We study the interplay of kerf topology and the mechanical behavior of the material in controlling the flexibility, load-bearing capacity, energy absorption, and bend-locking characteristics. Using brittle PLA with hexagon kerf topology results in high load bearing, energy absorption, and bend-locking due to good load resistance of the connectors, better packing ability of hexagon cells, and high strength of PLA. The use of ductile Onyx composite shows an interplay between connector buckling, densification, and inelastic material deformation, contributing to high energy dissipation and energy absorption, as well as good load bearing. Although no failure occurs in the compliant TPU kerf structures, their high flexibility results in low load bearing and low energy absorption. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Energy absorption; Flexibility; Kerfing; Load bearing; Onyx composites","Flexible structures; Locks (fasteners); Topology; Bearing behaviors; Bottom cells; Densifications; Energy; Flexibility; Freeform geometry; Kerfing; Load-bearing; Onyx composite; Thermoplastic polyurethanes; Densification","A.

However, accurately validating residual stress in numerical simulations remains a significant challenge. The present research pioneers the application of the contour method to non-conductive polymer composite materials using diamond wire cutting, breaking away from its traditional use on conductive materials. It establishes a robust experimental framework for assessing and refining numerical simulations in digital twinning of composite structures. A simple epoxy-carbon fiber reinforced cross-ply laminate with unbalanced asymmetric layup is employed in this study. It is ensured the material is elastically deformed during cutting by comparing the operating temperature and the glass transition temperature determined using Differential Scanning Calorimetry. The cut surfaces are thoroughly assessed using optical, confocal, scanning electron microscopy and high-resolution surface topological scanning to validate the contour method assumptions. This includes characterization of the microstructure, material defects and cutting artefacts affecting the deformation topology of the cut surfaces. The paper sets a minimum resolvable length scale for residual stress, considering the size of constituents and surface roughness caused by diamond wire cutting.

Three types of CFRP honeycomb core topologies (i.e. circular, square and hexagonal) with different cell wall thicknesses and heights were considered in the designs. The honeycomb samples were fabricated by the molding and bonding process, which is widely used in the easy, fast and economical manufacturing of thin-walled honeycomb structures. A total of twenty-seven sample groups were experimentally tested for each loading condition, in which honeycomb samples with different core topologies were designed to have almost the same weights for a meaningful comparison. The experimental results revealed that all honeycomb designs have higher in-plane compression strength in the expansion direction, and hexagonal honeycombs showed the highest strength and energy absorption performance in both directions due to their stable load-carrying capacity and outstanding force efficiency. In particular, the experimental findings showed that the crushing strength and the specific energy absorption of CFRP honeycomb structures can be improved up to 6.1 and 4.2 times, respectively, by properly adjusting the cell wall thickness and height parameters.

The methodology involves modifying flax fibers via cryogenic treatment to improve surface topology and thermal stability, alongside incorporating MWCNT into the DGEBA polymer to enhance composite properties. The effects of these modifications were evaluated through mechanical and thermal testing, focusing on tensile and flexural strengths, and degradation temperature. Results show that cryogenic treatment increases the thermal stability of flax fibers, raising degradation temperature by 10°C, attributed to an increase in hemicellulose composition. Mechanically, cryogenic-treated flax fiber composites without MWCNT demonstrated a 7.3% increase in tensile strength and a 28% increase in flexural strength. The dispersion of MWCNT in DGEBA improved tensile and flexural strength by 8.3% and 29%, respectively, in untreated flax fiber composites. When both cryogenic treatment and MWCNT dispersion were applied, tensile strength improved by 17.2% and flexural strength by 36.6%, attributed to enhanced interfacial bonding between the fiber and matrix.

Recent investigations into this domain have revealed an array of intriguing phases of carbon, among which amorphous graphite is the most notable for its unique mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties that arise from its inherent topological disorders. In this study, we utilized the ReaxFF molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the carbonization and graphitization processes involved in the production of amorphous graphite from benzothiophene, a sulfur-containing polar aromatic precursor. We developed C/H/S ReaxFF force field parameters to describe the high-temperature chemistry of benzothiophene. Our investigation reveals the reaction mechanisms, providing critical insights into the underlying chemical processes toward the formation of amorphous graphite and the structural characteristics of the end products. The formation of volatile gaseous molecules and their continuous elimination led to the development of noncontinuous layered graphite structures analogous to amorphous graphite consisting of pentagons, hexagons, and heptagons. These findings offer unprecedented insights into the carbonization and graphitization processes of sulfur-containing heavy-end aromatic feedstock.

In this study, advantages and challenges of 3D concrete printing in terms of low-carbon construction are systematically elaborated. Compared to traditional construction techniques, the benefits of 3DCP with respect to labor-saving and formwork-free cause revolutions in labor structure and building process, which can largely mitigate carbon emissions and wastes from traditional on-site construction. Moreover, the high flexibility of 3DCP technique in construction to complex structures provides possibilities for achieving new types of low-carbon structural designs. Innovative designs like topological structural optimization, energy integration and rebuildable design can contribute to material saving, energy conservation and resources recycling. Low carbon material design has been one of the critical issues for low carbon 3DCP. From this aspect, the utilization of solid wastes, lightweight concrete, geopolymer concrete and fiber-reinforced concrete for 3D printing can provide effective solutions.

This study focused on systematically assessing the electrical behaviors of UHPC with two commonly-used reinforcing conductive fillers, i.e. carbon fibers (CFs) and steel fibers (SFs). The effects of fiber type, fiber length, fiber content, and curing age on the alternating current (AC) resistivities and AC electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (AC-EIS) spectra of fiber-reinforced UHPC were investigated, and the equivalent circuit models of fiber-reinforced UHPC were established. Experimental results showed that the AC resistivities of UHPC with CFs and with SFs both exhibited a faster growth rate during the 14-28 d of curing, but subsequently decelerated after the completion of hydration, and stabilized at 90-120 d. Compared with the control sample, the addition of both CFs and SFs resulted in a reduction of the electrical resistivity of UHPC, with a more pronounced decrease observed with higher fiber content. In particular, the addition of SFs demonstrated a more significant reduction in UHPC’s AC resistivity in relative to CFs, with the addition of 4 vol.% copper-plated end-hook SFs remarkably lowering the resistivity by up to 87.5%. Furthermore, the introduction of different types of fibers caused remarkably different AC-EIS topologies of UHPC. The proposed equivalent circuit models reveal that compared to the control sample, the introduction of fibers can provide the fiber-fiber conductive paths and fiber-wrapped hydration products (Q F R F) within UHPC matrix. The role of UHPC matrix (Q 1 (R 1 W 1) in the conductive path of SFs-reinforced UHPC is weakened compared to that of CFs-reinforced UHPC as reflected by the differences in the impedance values of Nyquist plots. © 2023 IOP Publishing Ltd.","electrical resistivity; electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; equivalent circuit model; fibers; UHPC","Curing; Electric conductivity; Electric impedance measurement; Electrochemical corrosion; Hydration; Reduction; Steel fibers; Timing circuits; % reductions; Alternating current; Conductive paths; Control samples; Current resistivity; Electrical resistivity; Electrochemical-impedance spectroscopies; Equivalent circuit model; Fibers content; Fibre-reinforced; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy","S.

Dynamic problems with certain frequency responses arise in these practical situations, in which even a small excitation force could result in severe deformation in composite structures, thereby largely affecting the performance. To address this critical design issue, we propose a novel topology optimization approach for controlling dynamic responses of FRP structures. A discrete material and thickness optimization (DMTO) method is developed for parameterization of topological and fiber orientation variables, in which the Heaviside penalization of polynomial interpolation scheme (HP-PIS) and rational approximate material penalization (RAMP) method are adopted for variable discretization, respectively. A new frequency response analysis (for short nFRA) method is implemented and a decoupled sensitivity analysis is incorporated in the optimization process. The design aims to minimize the dynamic displacement responses of FRP composites under given volume fraction. To verify the computational efficiency and accuracy of the optimization process, a comparative study is first conducted with the conventional mode displacement method (MDM), mode acceleration method (MAM), and original adjoint variable method (AVM) through a benchmark example. The generality and robustness of the proposed optimization procedure are further validated through the several numerical problems for a given excitation frequency and frequency band. The results demonstrate considerable potential of the proposed method for solving the frequency based dynamic topology optimization of FRP composite structures. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Decoupled sensitivity analysis; Discrete material and thickness optimization; Fiber-reinforced plastic composites; Frequency response; Topology optimization","Acceleration; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Computational efficiency; Fibers; Sensitivity analysis; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Structure (composition); Topology; Automotive devices; Composites structures; Decoupled sensitivity analyse; Designability; Discrete material optimizations; Fiber-reinforced plastic composites; Multifunctionality; Thickness optimization; Topology optimisation; Wearable devices; Frequency response","D.

However, it remains a great challenge to simultaneously guarantee great dimension accuracy and superior mechanical performances of 3D-printed CFRCs. This paper proposed a novel crossing-lap strategy to arrange a continuous printing path for a topology-optimized Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) beam. The crossing-lap layer and the normal layer were alternately printed, employing different ratios of the crossing-lap layer relative to the overall layers (α) within the structure. Additionally, a three-point bending test results showed that the mechanical performance enhanced with an increase of α. Digital image correlation (DIC) and micro-CT results revealed a transition in the failure mode of the structure. Furthermore, a finite element (FE) model was developed to predict the stiffness of the 3D-printed structure, as well as to elucidate the failure mechanisms. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Continuous carbon fiber; Mechanical properties; Path strategy","3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bending performance; Continuous carbon fiber; Continuous fibers; Fibre-reinforced composite; Mechanical; Mechanical performance; Path strategy; Property; bending; carbon fiber; composite; digital image; failure mechanism; finite element method; stiffness; three-dimensional modeling; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","Z.

This study develops a framework to design and produce topologically optimized continuous carbon fiber reinforced composites (CCFRCs) with both high manufacturing efficiency and manufacturability, and experimentally validates via material extrusion (MEX) 3D printing technique in a more than 1-m wing spar for the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). The load-carrying structure can be topologically optimized by a solid orthotropic material with penalization method and further designed into a continuous fiber trajectory under the consideration of optimal material density, optimal fiber orientation and 3D printing process limitation. Based on this method, the complex topological CCFRCs can be realized by a single-stroke printing path with intact fiber. The feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework have been evaluated on the Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) beam which reveals obvious higher performance in specific stiffness and peak load compared with commonly used honeycomb structure. As a case study, a topologically optimized UAV wing spar was designed and validated experimentally. Mechanical testing shows that the designed wing spar can survive in operating loads.

The mechanical properties of these beams were evaluated through quasi-static three-point bending tests. A comparative analysis of load-carrying capacity, energy absorption, and specific energy absorption (SEA) indicates that octet lattice beams exhibit superior performance to cube lattice beams. The octet lattice beam in the triple-layer double-column (TL-DC) arrangement absorbed 14.99 J of energy, representing a 38% increase compared to the 10.86 J absorbed by the cube lattice beam in the same design. The specific energy absorption (SEA) of the octet beam was measured at 0.39 J/g, which exceeds the 0.29 J/g recorded for the cube beam. Two distinct types of deformations were identified for the struts and the beam layers. Octet struts exhibit enhanced performance in stretch-dominated zones, whereas the cube system demonstrates superior efficacy in compressive-dominated regions. The results highlight the enhanced efficacy of octet lattice structures in energy absorption and mechanical stability maintenance. The investigation of sandwich lattice topologies integrating octet and cube structures indicates that while hybrid designs may exhibit efficiency, uniform octet structures yield superior performance. This study provides valuable insights into the structural design and optimization of lattice systems for applications requiring high-energy absorption and mechanical robustness. © 2024 by the author.","3-point bending; chopped carbon fiber reinforced; cubic lattice topology; energy absorption performance; octet lattice topology","Bending tests; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Columns (structural); Crystal lattices; Rayon; Shape optimization; 3-point bending; Absorption performance; Carbon fiber reinforced; Chopped carbon fiber; Chopped carbon fiber reinforced; Cubic lattice; Cubic lattice topology; Energy; Energy absorption performance; Lattice topology; Octet lattice topology; Point bending; Struts","M.M.

In this context, we fabricate chiral composite metamaterials with gradient phase index to realize the mentioned conversion. The chiral composite metamaterials generate vortex waves with topological charges of ± 1 and ± 2 within broad bandwidth from linearly polarized waves, and the arrangement of meta-atoms with different geometric phases manipulate the chirality of vortex waves. Vortex zero of the electric field vector appears near the phase singularity, which induces the far-field diffusive nature of the vortices to enhance absorption.

This research aims to address the demand for a mold-independent approach for fabricating high-performance components. We present the hot powder bed compaction (HPBC) technique, which combines Fused Filament Fabrication (FFF) with a compaction process. This fabrication approach allows to control time-temperature-pressure parameters to ensure inter-layer fusion while preserving the geometric shape of the part. This process enables the fabrication of high-performance thermoplastic composite parts, incorporating topology-optimized geometry and tailored fiber orientation, without the need for part-specific mold. The effectiveness of the HPBC was demonstrated through tensile testing until failure of dog-bone coupons and dovetail joint, fabricated from short, discontinuous carbon fibers (SCF) filament. HPBC treated coupon with dovetail maintains the elastic modulus (2.73 GPa), strength (52.63 MPa) and enhance interlayer fusion as demonstrated in micrographs. This research demonstrates a versatile and effective post-printing technique for producing high-performance, void-free composite parts with optimized fiber orientation, effectively addressing the limitations of traditional FFF.

Graphene derivatives graphene oxide (GO) and reduced graphene oxide (rGO) exhibit excellent physical and chemical properties, presenting a room temperature ferromagnetic ordered structure. In order to achieve large-scale, low-cost, and stable performance of all-carbon films, a dual dimensional carbon composite strategy combining thermal reduction was adopted to prepare composite films of micro reduced graphene oxide fibers (rGOFs) and nano scale rGO sheets, and the ferromagnetic mechanism of all-carbon films was explained partially. This work prepared rGO-rGOFs all-carbon composite films with different masses of rGOFs, focusing on the ferromagnetic mechanism and magnetoresistance effect of the materials. The research results find that introducing a certain amount of rGOFs can increase the room temperature saturation magnetization of rGO films from 0.0083 to 0.0960 A·m2·kg–1. Enhancement of the ferromagnetism is achieved through combined effect of vacancy type defects and sp3(C–C) states in carbon film. Interference of metal impurities in the sample, which may affect the saturation magnetization, is eliminated by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. In addition, at room temperature and ±1 T magnetic field, the magnetoresistance (MR) curve shows MR value of sample is negative. By regulating the surface topology and sp3(C–C)/sp2(C=C) ratio of the material, the room temperature saturation magnetization has been improved to a higher extent. In short, this new type of all-carbon thin film is expected to be applied to spintronic devices and biomedical fields in the near future. © 2025 Science Press.

Multiscale models, including microscale, mesoscale and macroscale models, have been developed to characterize the TPB strength and damages. Thereinto, Representative Volume Elements (RVEs) of the microscale and mesoscale structures are established to determine the effective properties of carbon-fiber yarn and CFRP composites, respectively. Aimed at accurately and efficiently predicting the TPB behavior, an Equivalent Cross-Ply Laminate (ECPL) cell is proposed to simplify the inherent woven architecture, and the effective properties of the subcell are computed using a local homogenization approach. The macroscale model of the TPB specimen is constructed by a topology structure of ECPL cells to predict the mechanical behavior. The TPB experiments have been performed to validate the multiscale models. Both the experimental and numerical results reveal that delamination mainly appears in the top and bottom interfaces of the CFRP laminates. And matrix cracking and delamination are identified as the significant damage modes during the TPB process.

The case of Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm (MBB) beam under three-point bending test was studied and a path-based model was also built to analyse the effect of customised fibre placement and their lightweight performance. Experimental results showed that 3D printed composites with optimised fibre orientation achieved 305% and 256% higher strength and stiffness than Markforged® printed composites.

The material properties of the 3D printed carbon fibre reinforced polymers (CFRP) were firstly systematically investigated by extensive tensile tests aided by the digital image correlation (DIC) system, through which the microscale material anisotropy was clarified. Moreover, the accurate orthotropic material models were introduced into the as-fabricated mesoscale unit lattices with geometric errors to obtain the effective mechanical properties. Finally, mechanical performance of the macroscale structures was optimized by the integration of the ideal and as-fabricated unit lattices with the homogenization-based topology optimization method.

The equivalent performance of CNTRCs is calculated by the extended easy-to-implement rule of mixtures. Then, by considering two independent angle variables, a 3-dimensional (3D) concurrent optimization model for CNT orientation and material layout is constructed. To decrease the possibility of falling into local optimal solutions, a discrete interval method is proposed to divide the search space into specific subintervals, and thus the original optimization problem is changed into material selection and subinterval angle optimization problems. In addition, different from conventional fiber-reinforced composites, CNTRCs employ nanoscale filler as reinforcement, which makes it more beneficial to achieve local material strengthening. Therefore, to decrease the possibility of local optimal solutions and achieve local structural strengthening, a concurrent TO model involving CNTRCs and isotropic materials under the volume constraint is proposed to achieve the optimal balance between structural stiffness and economy. Subsequently, the sensitivities of structural compliance with respect to design, selection, and angle variables are derived. Also, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by 2D and 3D examples. © 2023","Carbon nanotube reinforced composites; Continuous orientation design; Discrete interval method; Local material strengthening; Topology optimization","Fiber reinforced plastics; Optimal systems; Shape optimization; Topology; Carbon nanotubes reinforced composites; Continuous orientation design; Discrete interval method; Discrete intervals; Interval methods; Local material strengthening; Local materials; Nanotube orientation; Optimization design; Topology optimisation; Carbon nanotubes","S.

Initially lacking suspension mechanisms and constructed with heavy materials, manufacturers gradually integrated lightweight materials like aluminum and carbon fiber, which are now widely used. This progress extended to associated systems such as dampers to improve customer comfort and performance, the bicycle industry focused on developing lighter components and reducing overall weight. Additive manufacturing played a crucial role, enabling flexible fabrication and reverse engineering, allowing the creation of unique components based on topologically optimized geometries. This approach facilitated automated production of personalized bike devices tailored to individual preferences. Topological optimization, a technique in structural analysis, emerged as a means to reduce weight while maintaining mechanical functionality, particularly in weight-critical applications. It found a successful application in additive manufacturing technologies like selective laser sintering, enabling the production of complex geometries. Customizing bike components based on customer desires reduced material usage and overall weight, leading to improved performance and comfort. The manuscript discusses the development of a geometrically optimized mountain bike frame using topological optimization algorithms. The focus is on reducing frame weight through additive manufacturing, with a dimensioning study analyzing loads and adhering to safety standards. Carbon fiber 800H, known as Torayca T800H, was chosen as the material for optimization and simulations. This study represents a significant advancement in reducing weight and customizing mountain bikes through additive manufacturing. The application of topological optimization and advanced materials contributes to enhanced performance, comfort, and rider satisfaction. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Advanced digital geometry; CAD; Industrial design; Simulated based design; Topological optimization","3D printing; Additives; Bicycles; Computer aided design; Geometry; Landforms; Laser heating; Sintering; Topology; Advanced digital geometry; Bike frame; Component based; Design optimization; Digital geometry; Geometrical optimization; Mountain bike; Performance; Simulated based design; Topological optimization; Product design","D.

It is produced by tailoring the electrical conductivity of concrete with the addition of conductive materials such as carbon fiber. This paper aims at determining the electrical conductivity of smart concrete materials with randomly dispersed carbon fibers. It unravels the conduction mechanism and establishes a theoretical basis of the percolation threshold for conduction. A numerical model for concrete with carbon fiber is developed. The electrical conduction through the concrete is calculated by solving the governing equations based on Kirchhoff's reformulation of Ohm's Law. More than ten thousand cases with varying fiber topologies, fiber fraction ratios and aspect ratios have been generated to account for the randomness of distribution and their electrical properties are evaluated. By analyzing those results, the mechanism behind the percolation threshold is explained. Finally, an algebraic relationship is posited to determine the percolation threshold has been evaluated. The relationship has been validated with experimental results. The results are extremely valuable for the design of self-sensing smart concrete. © 2023 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Carbon fibers; Concrete; Electrical conductivity; Numerical models; Percolation threshold; Topologies","Aspect ratio; Carbon fibers; Conductive materials; Electric conductivity; Numerical models; Percolation (computer storage); Percolation (fluids); Solvents; Concrete; Concrete materials; Conduction Mechanism; Electrical conduction; Electrical conductivity; Percolation thresholds; Self-sensing; Smart concrete; State of stress; Stress and strain; carbon fiber; concrete; electrical conductivity; electrical property; experimental study; numerical model; percolation; strain; stress; Topology","A.

Topological freedom provided by modern additive manufacturing allows optimization of the parameters of the socket to create an orthopaedic prosthesis with properties adapted to the needs of a particular patient. This paper proposes an approach to redistribute the pressure in the prosthesis by controlled reinforcement with continuous carbon rods to artificially create zones of higher and lower pressure to facilitate prosthetic wear. Numerical modelling is used for the pre-design of a unique internal architecture of the prosthesis, which can redistribute the pressure on the inner surface of the socket, thus relieving excessive pressure from sensitive soft-tissue zones.

After several advances in material and topological optimisations, sport-purpose feet prosthetics have reached high-level performances, allowing athletes with limb loss to participate in various sport activities at a competitive level. Since the knowledge of prosthetic mechanical behaviour is crucial for its optimal design, specific studies are required to meet the anthropometric characteristics of the athlete. This research work is focused on investigating the dynamic behaviour of a running blade prosthetic and developing a validated prosthetic model, placing particular emphasis on the definition of suitable material properties. An experimental modal analysis is performed on the Cheetah Xcel, Össur lower limb prosthetic. In contrast with what has already been presented in the literature, a roving hummer test under free–free conditions is proposed here to avoid the uncertainties due to constraint conditions. For the first time, blade prosthetic dynamic characteristics in free–free conditions are presented. Additionally, a novel Finite Element model of the prosthetic is developed and tuned on the basis of the experimental results. The modal assurance criterion index is exploited to compare experimental and numerical mode shapes. Starting from frequency response functions, the first six mode shapes are experimentally identified in the frequency range up to 750 Hz, including both bending and torsion. As expected, the bending in the vertical plane constitutes the primary mode shape: this kind of flexion enhances energy storage, enabling athletes to achieve an optimal running gait. This study shows the dynamic modal behaviour of a lower limb prosthetic in free–free conditions and demonstrates that a traditional isotropic material is not suitable in describing its dynamic features. The development of a model that exploits orthotropic material properties improves the alignment between experimental and numerical outcomes. This result is in agreement with the material composition of the prosthetic, which consists of carbon fibre layers. © 2023 by the authors.","carbon fibre and epoxy matrix; composite prosthetic; lower limb prosthetic leg; modal analysis; numerical–experimental correlation; orthotropic material","","A.D.

Harnessing the novel capabilities of individual fiber design requires knowledge of the physical constraints related to the fiber, as well as the constraints of the additive manufacturing process. This paper will discuss what parameters a designer must consider in their design - bend radii, overhang angles, tow cross sections, surface finishes, fiber intersections and printer geometries to achieve a successful final component. Case studies of actual parts and test results will be presented in addition to best practices for design of continuous carbon fiber steered composites. Copyright © 2023.

Because of their negative Poisson's ratio, auxetics behave counterintuitively and contract orthogonally under an applied compressive force, resulting in a densification of material in the vicinity of the applied load. This study investigates three cellular structures and compares their compressive energy absorbing characteristics under in-plane and axial loading conditions. Three unit cell topologies are considered; a conventional hexagonal, re-entrant and double arrowhead auxetic structures. The samples were additively manufactured using two different materials, a conventional Nylon and a carbon fibre reinforced composite alternative (Onyx). Finite element simulations are experimentally validated under out of and in-plane loading conditions and the double arrowhead (auxetic) structure is shown to exhibit comparatively superior energy absorption. For the carbon fibre reinforced material, Onyx, the specific energy absorbed by the double arrowhead geometry was 125% and 244% greater than the hexagonal (non-auxetic) and re-entrant (auxetic) structures respectively. © 2022 The Author(s)","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Auxetic; Cellular structures; Composite; Energy absorption","Additives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Cellular automata; Cellular manufacturing; Energy absorption; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Auxetic structures; Auxetics; Cellular structure; Energy absorption capability; Inplane loading; Loading condition; Quasi-static loading; Sandwich panel; 3D printers","Z.

The monocoque is loved by Formula Student teams around the world because it has a higher stiffness and lighter weight than the truss steel tube body. With the widespread application of monocoque, it also brings more problems. Due to the use of the monocoque, the connection between each component and the body was changed from the welding of the original truss steel pipe frame to a bolted connection. However, the bolted connection will provide a large preload force to the monocoque, resulting in the monocoque easily crushed in the local, so it is necessary to pre-bury an enhanced part in the monocoque to ensure the connection strength, that is, the embedded part. At present, aluminum plug-ins after topological hollow processing are being used. Although the weight is reduced a lot, the assembly cross-sectional area is reduced, resulting in the inserts are easy to loosen, the connection is unstable, and even the lifting ears may be loose under severe working conditions, so that the vehicle is in an extremely unsafe state. It is necessary to optimize the material and bonding conditions of the inserts. In this paper, two engineering plastics, PPS and PPS with 30% glass fiber (PPS30), were selected and the bonding conditions were optimized in terms of several variables. The results show that the bonding strength is improved by the use of PPS30 and the optimization of the bonding conditions. © 2023 SAE International.

However, low fiber-direction compressive strength, compared to intermediate-modulus (IM) CFRPs currently used in primary structures, has been a well-recognized weakness of HM CFRPs, prohibiting their implementation in rotorcraft platforms. Microstructural tailoring provides an innovative means for breaking through the fiber-direction compressive strength barrier of the HM CFRPs. Microbuckling, the fiber-direction compressive failure mechanism of the subject HM and IM CFRPs, is driven by fiber-matrix interface shear strength. Assessments of the interface properties using in-situ SEM-based experiments reveal substantial difference in surface topology between IM and HM fibers, which is related to higher interface strength in IM fibers. This instigates a microstructural tailoring approach of reinforcing material surrounding HM fibers with IM fibers to improve microstructural stability. A manufacturing system has been developed, and promising results enabling HM CFRPs with adequate fiber-direction compressive strength have been achieved through hybridization of IM and HM fibers at the filament level in HM CFRP toughened with nano-silica. A new material achieving compressive strength of IM CFRPs but with > 30% higher modulus has been developed. Copyright © 2023 by the Vertical Flight Society.

The optimization design of key load-bearing components can significantly reduce the weight of heavy-duty AGVs and their energy consumption during operation, leading to decreasing manufacturing and usage costs. Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) was used as a lightweight replacement material, and the assembly was designed from material to structure to optimize the key load-bearing components of an 80t class AGV. The bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization (BESO) method was used to optimize the frame and rudder wheel mounting plate separately, while the cell sensitivity filtering technique was used to eliminate the fine bifurcation structure, resulting in an optimized structure suitable for actual manufacturing. Secondly, CFRP specimens with different layers and weave directions were prepared, and tensile and in-plane shear experiments were conducted to obtain the mechanical property of CFRP. Subsequently, the lay-up angles of the composite laminates were optimized, and the simulation results show that the optimal lay-up angles [–12/33/55/–68] of composite material can reduce the maximum Mises stress and displacement by 25.79% and 9.95%, respectively. Finally, a finite element analysis was performed, and the results show that the optimization design can reduce the weight of heavy-duty AGV significantly. The total mass of the optimized structure is reduced by 21.79% without significantly increasing the maximum stress and displacement, in which the mass of rudder wheel mounting plate is reduced to 8.83% after adopting the angle-optimized CFRP paving set. The modal analysis shows that the first sixth-order eigenfrequency of the new structure decreases slowly with increasing load in the approved working conditions, and varies smoothly between 61.95 and 109.75 Hz under full load. This work provides some guidelines for low energy consumption and low-cost manufacturing of heavy-duty AGVs. © 2023 Editorial Department of Journal of Sichuan University.

However, due to the reversibility of dynamic bonds, the CANs and composites suffer accidental degradation and failure upon a certain stimulus (moisture, acid/base, reductant/oxidant, etc.) in the application environment. Herein, inspired by parallel circuits, interlocked covalent adaptable networks (ICANs) were prepared by one-pot reactions from epoxy monomers and two curing agents that contained different dynamic bonds of aromatic disulfide and aromatic imine bonds, resulting in dual dynamic parallel cross-links in homogeneous epoxy networks. The ICANs exhibited outstanding mechanical properties and improved stability, relying on the topological interlocking structure. The ICANs could be unlocked and became degradable only when two stimuli were both applied to completely break the cross-links of disulfide bonds and imine bonds. When applying ICANs as a matrix to form carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites, the resulted CFRP inherited the interlocking properties from the ICANs, exhibiting improved stability and nondestructive recyclability. Maintaining the degradable properties, the interlocking structure of networks provided a facile way to optimize the stability of CANs and their composites.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","","Aromatic polymers; Aromatization; Carbon fibers; Covalent bonds; Crosslinking; Electric connectors; Polymer matrix composites; %moisture; Acid base; Aromatic disulfides; Aromatic imines; Epoxy; Imine bonds; Interlocking structure; ON dynamics; Parallel connections; Property; Sulfur compounds","L.

This study considered three TPMS cell topologies, including Diamond, Gyroid, and Primitive. The FDM process was used to print the lattice structures with two materials: pure polylactic acid (PLA) and carbon fiber-reinforced PLA (PLA + CF). The influence of carbon fiber (CF) incorporation, unit cell type (topologies) and size, and relative density (RD) on mechanical properties and failure patterns were explored comprehensively under uniaxial compression testing. The results demonstrate a change in the compressive modulus (0.09 to 0.47 GPa), compressive strength (2.98 to 13.89 MPa), and specific energy absorption (SEA) (0.14 MJ/m3/g to 0.58 MJ/m3/g) due to the influence of CF incorporation, cell type and size, and RD. Results indicate that the Diamond structure outperformed both Primitive and Gyroid structures in terms of compressive modulus and strength, and SEA. All the CF-based TPMS structures showed a higher compressive modulus. Compressive strength and energy absorption capacity were both slightly enhanced in most PLA + CF-based Diamond structures. On the contrary, Gyroid and Primitive structures showed better performance for pure PLA-based structures in terms of compression strength and specific absorption energy. © 2022 by the authors.","absorption energy; additive manufacturing; carbon fiber; composite; FDM; lattice structures; PLA; TPMS structures","Biomechanics; Carbon fibers; Compression testing; Compressive strength; Density (specific gravity); Diamonds; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Topology; Absorption energies; Cell types; Compressive moduli; Gyroids; Lattice structures; Minimum surfaces; Polylactic acid; Relative density; Specific energy absorption; Triply periodic minimum surface structure; 3D printers","M.

These samples are fabricated using extrusion-based 3D printing, with topological parameters such as shell thickness (ST), unit cell type (UCT), wall thickness (WT), unit cell orientation (UCO), skewing angle (SA), and unit cell size (UCS) being manipulated across three different levels. The experimental findings indicate that achieving the lowest dimensional length error is attainable under specific conditions, including a smaller ST of 0.5 mm, a square UCT, a WT of 0.5 mm, a UCO of 90°, a SA of 0°, and a UCS of 4 mm. Analyzing the results with ANOVA reveals that UCT (28.82%) and WT (18.73%) exert the most significant influence on the dimensional stability response. The regression model closely aligns with experimental outcomes, with an error percentage of 3%, rendering it suitable for large-scale customization. Under the optimized topological parameters, carbon fiber-reinforced PETG latticed composites exhibited a dimensional length error of 0.292 mm and a compressive strength of 21.56 MPa. Fractography analysis revealed a brittle mode of fracture across all samples, indicating their stiffness and strength, especially when compared to samples with lower wall thickness. These findings suggest that the designed carbon fiber-reinforced PETG latticed composite material holds potential for use in minor surgical orthotic and prosthetic applications.

If it is pushed to the extreme, these concepts can consist of highly controlled lattice structures subject to biomimetic material design and topology optimization (TO). However, the strong coupling among the composition and the topology of the porous microstructure hinders the conventional trial-and-error approaches. In this work, discontinuous carbon fiber-reinforced polymer matrix composite materials were adopted for structural design. A three-dimensional (3D) periodic lattice block inspired by cuttlefish bone combined with computer modeling-based topology optimization was proposed. Through computer modeling, complex 3D periodic lattice blocks with various porosities were topologically optimized and realized, and the mechanical properties of the topology-optimized lattice structures were characterized by computer modeling. The results of this work were compared with other similar designs and experiments to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed approach provides a design tool for more affordable and higher-performance structural materials. © 2023 by the author.","biomimetics; carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (CFRPCs); computer modeling; cuttlefish bone; discontinuous carbon fibers (DiCFs); lattice structure; lightweight; mechanical properties; topology optimization (TO)","","Z.

The work is conducted by initially developing a DOE varying two parameters in 3D printing namely (i) infill ratio and (ii) infill pattern. Then based on standards ASTM D638 and ISO178, for tensile and flexural tests, specimens are 3D printed and tested for the material Nylon with CFRP (Onyx). From the results it can be observed that (i) specimen with an infill ratio of 85% (constant triangular infill pattern) was found to have the best performance recording a length extension of approximately 5.6 mm under a tensile load of 700 N (ii) in case of infill pattern, triangular shape (constant infill ratio of 37%) recorded the highest the length extension of 7.3 mm under tensile load of 650 N. (iii) 85% infill ratio (constant triangular infill pattern) recorded a bending deflection of approximately 6 mm under a compressive load of 250 N and (iv) the gyroid infill pattern (constant infill ratio of 37%) provided the highest flexural strength with an approximate extension of 5.6 mm under a compressive load of 350 N. After the experimental study and analysing the best parameters, a static analysis and topology optimisation for the 3D printed material (Nylon with CFRP(Onyx)) has been performed on an industrial part for its design validation. Based on the analysis, the original part is redesigned, and again a static analysis simulation is performed to determine the effects of the optimisation process for the same material comparing with 316L-Stainless Steel (SS). Finally, the redesigned model is manufactured with the best 3D printing parameters and validated against the original operating conditions. This study will help industries to use these 3D printing parameters where a metal-based components needs to be replaced with CFRP. © 2023","Additive Manufacturing; Build parameters; Carbon Fibre Reinforcement (CFR); Mechanical properties","3D printing; Bending strength; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Rayon; Static analysis; Tensile stress; Topology; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Build Parameters; Building parameters; Carbon fiber reinforcement; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Complex model; Compressive loads; Tensile loads; Polyamides","A.

The use of locally and seasonally available agricultural fibers as a basis for biocomposites, however, challenges current design paradigms due to the unique mechanical properties of each material. The paper presents a cross-scalar framework that includes the geospatial mapping of available agricultural fibers globally, which leads to five regionally specific biocomposites. Each biocomposite includes a natural fiber blended with two universally available additives - a biodegradable binder and cellulose. These 3D printable biocomposites are experimentally characterized in ways that allow strength and stiffness in bending and compression to be understood relative to the orientation of the print paths. These orthotropic properties are finally integrated in a new computational approach as the final element in the framework. The system uses topology optimization to derive the forms for components that are structurally optimized based on what fibers are available locally, and taking the specific directional mechanical properties of 3D printed morphology into account. Two design cases demonstrate that the cross-scalar mapping and computational optimization approach allow for material savings that approach 30% compared to a standard approach that would be based on the weakest blend within the fiber-based composite family. © 2024 Association for Computer Aided Design in Architecture.

The elastic–plastic compressive response of these solids is measured up to their densification regime. Data from experiments on the lattices with uniform relative density are used to deduce the dependence of their elastic–plastic homogenized constitutive response on their relative density, in the range 0.2–0.8. These data are used to calibrate finite element (FE) simulations of the compressive response of functionally graded lattices (FGLs), which are found in good agreement with the corresponding measurements, capturing the salient features of the measured stress versus strain responses. This exercise is repeated for two lattice topologies (body-centered cubic and Schwarz-P).

To handle this issue, a back propagation neural network (BPNN) model with a topology of 4–10-2 was designed, which was further optimized with the Ant colony optimization (ACO), Genetic algorithm (GA) and Particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithms. The models intended to establish non-linear relationships among the input layer parameters, viz., expanded graphite (EG), carbon fiber (CF), slag powder (SP), and fly ash (FA) contents, and the output layer parameters including the CM's compressive strength and resistivity. A total of 112 groups of data points were used for model development, including 80 groups of training set data, and two series of 16 data groups for verification and testing. Influence of conductive materials on compressive strength and resistivity of CM was determined with a correlation analysis. Meanwhile, the importance and total scores of different proportions were analyzed by performing a principal component analysis on the dataset. It was found that both the EG and FA content were correlated negatively with the CM's compressive strength and resistivity. In addition, the CF and SP contents were correlated positively with the CM's compressive strength but negatively with resistivity. The order of the conductive substances’ importance in CM's compressive strength and resistivity was EG > CF > SP > FA, and the group B-3 was determined as the best mix ratio. The PSO-BPNN model had the highest accuracy in predicting both the CM's compressive strength and resistivity, which can provide guidance for mix design of CM. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","BP neural network; Compressive strength; Conductive mortar; Principal component analysis; Resistivity","Ant colony optimization; Carbon fibers; Compressive strength; Conductive materials; Fly ash; Genetic algorithms; Neural networks; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Slags; Topology; Back-propagation neural networks; BP neural networks; Conductive mortars; Expanded graphite; Graphite carbon; Layer parameters; Neural network model; Principal-component analysis; Resistivity; Slag powder; Principal component analysis","Y.

The designability of CFRP structures and fiber distributions provides an opportunity for achieving better physical properties through optimization. However, local optima and the dependence of initial fiber angle variables make the concurrent optimization of fiber orientation and topology a challenging problem. In this paper, the principal stress orientation interpolated continuous fiber angle optimization (PSO-CFAO) method combined with the independent continuous mapping (ICM) method is proposed to realize the design of CFRP structures with a clear macroscopic topology and microscopic fiber distribution. A sigmoid function is applied to interpolate the fiber angle variables by the principal stress orientation. The fiber angle variables are modified and a continuous fiber design is obtained during the iteration process, which reduces the possibility of a local optimum. Several examples are provided to prove the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method, and the expected results are acquired for different initial fiber angles, material parameters and mesh densities.

Considering that construction constitutes one of the most significant contributors to carbon emissions throughout the entire life-cycle of a building, there is an urgent desire to incorporate timber into this domain. Nevertheless, the use of timber faces inherent challenges stemming from its anisotropic nature, a result of the natural growth of timber fibers, which makes it challenging for it to function as a primary load-bearing material in coping with the various complex stresses inherent in architectural applications. Numerous designers have attempted to address this limitation through over-sized members and reinforcement at joints; however, none have satisfactorily resolved this issue in an economical manner. In this article, we introduce the Strut-and-Tie models (STM) from Graphic Statics (GS) and a topological optimization algorithm. This algorithm has the capability to generate a ‘load-minimizing path’ STM based on external load support conditions and the maximum structural path span. Regardless of the complexity of the initial external loads, each load transfer path in the optimized STM bears loads in only one direction, representing an optimal solution with minimal internal loads that align seamlessly with the characteristics of timber. Consequently, we endeavor to adopt this optimization algorithm to propose a structural design methodology, with the aspiration of designing structural systems that harness the unique attributes of timber perfectly and applying them to various architectural scenarios. Ultimately, we conclude that structural systems designed based on optimized STM are adaptable to diverse architectural contexts, and when applied to small-scale buildings, this method can save approximately 20% of material consumption compared to conventional timber frame structures, while in the case of mid-rise to high-rise buildings, it can lead to a material savings of approximately 5%. © 2023 by the authors.","graphic statics; structure optimization; strut-and-tie models; timber","Architectural design; Carbon; Construction industry; Graphic methods; Life cycle; Structural design; Structural optimization; Tall buildings; External loads; Graphic statics; Low carbon; Model optimization; Optimization algorithms; Structural systems; Structure design; Structure optimization; Strut-and-tie model; Timber structures; Timber","Y.

Herein, two vanillin-based epoxy monomers, shorted as VAD-EP and VDP-EP, containing both imine bonds and inherently fire retarding phosphorus elements, were synthesized via in situ condensation reaction with DDM and addition reaction with DOPO, followed by the epoxidation by epichlorohydrin. Epoxy vitrimer materials were then cured by D230 diamine hardener by adjusting the proportion of VAD-EP and VDP-EP monomer. When the mass ratio of VAD-EP and VDP-EP was 8:2, A8P2-D230 reached the fire retarding UL-94 V0 rating and LOI value of 27.0% with only 0.66% of phosphorus content, this behavior was ascribed to condensed phase and free radical scavenging mechanisms. When the mass ratio was 7:3, the tensile strength and elastic modulus of the A7P3-D230 epoxy were 75.5 MPa and 2.5 GPa, respectively, i.e. 48.6% and 18.8% higher than A10P0-D230 sample. Meanwhile, the material showed high stress relaxation rate, due to the presence of dynamic imine bonds in the topological crosslinking network. As a consequence, the epoxy vitrimer exhibited excellent self-healing capability, reprocessability and degradation behaviors. The biobased epoxy vitrimer was then used to prepare the carbon fibers (CFs) reinforced epoxy composites, results showed that CFs can be completely recycled. Interestingly, the recycled CFs maintain unchanged chemical structure, mechanical properties and morphology as the original CFs. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Degradability; Epoxy vitrimer; Flame retardancy; Reprocessability; Self-healing; Vanillin","Amines; Condensation reactions; Crosslinking; Epoxy resins; Free radicals; Monomers; Phosphorus; Recycling; Self-healing materials; Stress relaxation; Synthesis (chemical); Tensile strength; Bio-based; Degradability; Epoxy; Epoxy vitrimer; Flame-retardancy; Imine bonds; Mass ratio; Reprocessability; Self-healing; Vanillin; Addition reactions","P.

Young patients are still at risk of aseptic mobilization and bone resorption due to the phenomenon of stress shielding that causes an uneven distribution of tensions along the femoral contact surface prosthesis. This phenomenon can be limited by choosing the material of the prosthesis appropriately or by varying its stiffness, making sure that its mechanical behavior simulates that of the femur as much as possible. The aim of this study is to evaluate the mechanical strength of a prosthesis optimized both in shape and material and compare the results with a standard titanium prosthesis. Methods: Through three-dimensional modeling and the use of finite element method (FEM) software such as ANSYS, the mechanical behavior of traditional prosthesis and prosthesis optimized topologically respecting the ASTM F2996-13 standard. Results: With topological optimization, there is a stress reduction from 987 MPa to 810 MPa with a mass reduction of 30%. When carbon fiber is used, it is possible to further reduce stress to 509 MPa. Conclusions: The reduction in stress on the femoral stem allows an optimal distribution of the load on the cortical bone, thus decreasing the problem of stress shielding. © 2023 by the authors.","composite material; finite element analysis; hip prosthesis; stress shielding; topological optimization","","M.

Of particular interest within this material category are periodic lattice materials, which – in combination with advances in additive manufacturing technologies – allow not only for repeatable behavior, but also for a high degree of customization. In this paper, the crashworthiness of “sandwich” lattice structures is investigated, using both experimental and numerical investigations. After characterizing the quasi-static mechanical performance of solid nylon-carbon fiber and a solid engineering resin material, the response of single-layer cubic and octet lattices with a relative density of 30% made from those materials was characterized and compared. The response of multi-layer cubic and octet lattices was investigated before finally layering single-layer octet and cubic topologies to form two unique “sandwich” lattices. Stress-strain, efficiency-strain and other crashworthiness parameter data was gathered, and it was found that while the three-layer single-topology lattices were capable of absorbing 9.8 J (cube) and 7.8 J (octet), the designed sandwich lattices were experimentally capable of absorbing more: 19.0 J (octet-cube-octet) and 22.4 J (cube-octet-cube). © 2023, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

Biopolymer-based composites consisting of cellulose, chitin, and chitosan are sustainable materials that may be utilised as necessary. In light of the present biomedical issues, hydroxyapatite and starch combinations have immense potential for generating sustainable biomaterials. Carbon, which is a key category of sustainable biomaterials, is found in a wide range of carbonaceous gels and biomaterials based on cellulose fibres and carbon nanotube. The goal of this article is to give a thorough review of a few of the most recent developments, uses, and challenges for biomaterials made from sustainable resources. In this article, the authors have initially covered different biomaterials such as metallic, polymeric, ceramic, and composite and their properties and applications. Sustainable manufacturing techniques for biomaterials such as 3D and 4D printing are also covered in this article. Different sustainable biomaterials are covered with their properties and applications such as protein-based, cellulose, chitin, and chitosan composite-based, hydroxyapatite-starch-based and carbonaceous biomaterials. At last, future scope and opportunities in sustainable biomaterials and manufacturing techniques are covered.

The best lamination scheme of the laminated plate used in the composite helmet was investigated, and the stress-strain curve of the laminated plate was obtained through experiments. The penetration, crash, and stiffness performance data of different helmets were compared, and the finite element software LS-DYNA was used for numerical simulation to obtain the effects of different materials on the performance and quality of helmets. The ABAQUS software was used to optimize the topology of the helmet model. Under the condition that the stiffness of the helmet was basically unchanged, the stiffener structure of the helmet was optimized to reduce the thickness of the helmet surface and realize lightweight. Results show that the mass of the continuous glass fiber reinforced thermoplastic helmet was reduced by 14. 6% and the stiffness was increased by 10.6% compared with ordinary ABS helmet. The mass of the glass fiber helmet with stiffener structure was reduced by 14. 2%, and the stiffness was consistent with that of the ordinary ABS helmet, but it saved more materials and had higher cost performance.

However, the organic–inorganic heterogeneous interfacial compatibility in traditional inorganic composites mainly depends on the loose crystal layers via hydrogen bonding, which is prone to faults and the hole wall damaged under strong forces. Here, a molecular topological structure was constructed in the composites system. Our process includes generating dendritic molecular chains on bamboo fiber, activating crystals to increase active sites, and inducing the confined growth of crystals on bamboo fiber through the action of hydrogen bonding and electrostatic adsorption. A chitosan-acrylic acid graft copolymer (CS-g-PAA) was introduced, which responded to weak alkali environment, achieved multi-mode bonding effects such as dynamic hydrogen bond, ionic complex bond, enhanced covalent bond, metal coordination bond and polymer network. Therefore, achieving deep cross fusion of heterogeneous interfaces through this method endows topologically composites (TCS) with many unique properties such as lightweight ultrastrong, thermal insulation, shock absorption, and fire resistance. The TCS was 8 times stronger than traditional insulation materials, and the thermal conductivity (0.07–0.085 W·m−1·k−1) was much lower than that of other inorganic insulation materials.

Robot aided lower limb rehabilitation has been studied for the last three decades and a few over-actuated and underactuated robot designs have been proposed in the literature. Over-actuated robots give more controlled motions, whereas underactuated designs allow unconstrained naturalistic motions. Designing an underactuated robot is difficult as it must be lightweight and yet strong enough to scaffold human lower limbs during gait. In this research, a Stephenson III six-bar linkage is modified to be used as single-actuated lower limb robot. The proposed robot design couples two four-bar linkages in a driver-driven mode to provide motions, which are equivalent to the motions from a six-bar linkage. A digital twin of the underactuated robot is developed to conduct in-silico experiments and evaluate the use of three different materials namely, aluminum alloy, structural steel, and fiber reinforced carbon composite. Finite element analysis (FEA) modeling is carried out using the Ansys workbench to assess mechanical performance indices. In order to minimize the overall weight of the robot, structural optimization is carried out using a multi-mode single objective genetic algorithm. Functional and nonfunctional design requirements are formulated as constraints to be used during the optimization experiments. The topology and material optimization presented in this article provides insights into the robot design requirements and the optimization process. As a result of this process, a significant reduction in the robot weight is achieved without compromising the mechanical performance. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","finite element analysis; Gait rehabilitation; genetic algorithm; topology optimization","Aluminum alloys; Carbon carbon composites; Finite element method; Genetic algorithms; Machine design; Reinforcement; Scaffolds; Shape optimization; Steel fibers; Structural optimization; Topology; Finite element analyse; Gait rehabilitation; Lower limb; Material optimization; Mechanical performance; Robot designs; Six-bar linkages; Topology optimisation; Underactuated; Underactuated robot; Robots","F.

In order to meet these varying demands of rotors and propellers, there are many different motor topologies that have been studied, such as, radial flux motors with inner rotors, out-runner motors, and axial flux motors. Due to the nature of the rotor design for space and noise, the relatively low prop RPM favors electric machine designs with highest torque/weight ratio. Presented here is a design concept with novel rotor permanent magnet array with carbon fiber integration, combined with advanced cooling schemes to achieve the market leading torque/weight ratio for continuous operation as well as peak power modes. With the various operational modes of the aircraft, trade-studies must be made to achieve the overall best performance, for instance, the lift motor needs to be as light as possible with relatively short time operation during take-off and landing, which leads to an optimized design target with almost highest torque/weight ratio, while its energy conversion efficiency is sacrificed.

In the previous studies, numerous carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen group single element films, such as arsenic, antimony, and tellurium, have been obtained. Tellurene is a basic material of the oxygen group with a helical chain structure. It may form various morphologies, such as nanowires, nanorods, nanotubes, or nanoribbons. On the one hand, preparing a thin layer of single tellurene crystal remains a challenge. On the other hand, as one of the chalcogenide elements (group Ⅵ materials), tellurene is a promising material for infrared optical applications because of its wideband absorption, high mobility, and unique topological properties. The electrical and topological properties of tellurene single crystals have been systematically studied. A second harmonic property in the optical nonlinear characteristics has also been observed. However, nonlinear applications, especially an ultrafast pulsed fiber laser based on the saturable absorption of tellurene, require further studies. In the present study, tellurene nanoflakes with high crystallinity were prepared by adopting the chemical vapor transport method. Using the precise transfer technology, the tellurium nanoflakes were integrated into the tip of the optical fiber as fiber-compatible saturable absorbers. The nonlinear saturation absorption property enabled achieving stable passively Q-switched laser pulses. It is envisaged that the present work will extend the range of applications of novel tellurene nanomaterials and provide a potential means of obtaining tunable pulsed lasers. Methods A tellurene-based saturable absorber was prepared using a bottom-up approach and then used for laser pulse generation. Firstly, tellurium powder and mica substrate were placed on each side of the middle-necked quartz tube. The quartz tube was sealed under vacuum and then placed in a double temperature zone furnace. By executing an appropriate temperature program, the source material was vaporized, transported, and recrystallized. The as-grown nanoflakes were characterized using optical microscope, atomic force microscope, electron microscope, and a Raman spectrometer. Then, the tellurium nanoflakes were integrated into the tip of the optical fiber as fiber-compatible saturable absorbers using our polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) -assisted accurate transfer method. Finally, the fiber-compatible saturable absorbers were integrated into an in-house erbium-doped fiber laser ring cavity for laser pulse generation. Results and Discussions Tellurene nanoflakes were prepared using a bottom-up approach and then comprehensively characterized. The thickness of the as-grown tellurene nanoflakes was about tens of nanometers and the maximum transverse size was 80 μm. The E1 (transverse to mode), A1, and E2 active Raman phonon modes of tellurium were found consistent with their typical characteristic peaks reported previously. The characteristic crystal plane is consistent with the PDF card (JCPDS # 36-1452). Furthermore, the high-resolution transmission electron microscopy image showed a clear atomic image. The prepared tellurene nanoflakes have high elemental purity. All characterization methods confirmed that the tellurene nanoflakes have high crystalline quality. The saturated absorption characteristic was studied with a double arm detection system. By fitting the saturable absorption curve to the data, the modulation depth, saturation strength, and unsaturated loss were found to be 0. 5%, 0. 66 GW/cm2, and 99. 16%, respectively. Benefiting from the excellent nonlinear saturation absorption property of tellurene, a stable passively Q-switched laser was realized. The Q-switched pulses are achieved at a communication band with a center wavelength of ~1558 nm and pulse duration of 1. 44 μs, and the repetition frequency is adjustable from 87 to 133 kHz. Additionally, the signal-to-noise ratio is ~53. 96 dB, indicating good pulse stability. The reported results point out a potential way to achieve tunable pulsed lasers. Conclusions Tellurene nanoflakes have been prepared using a bottom-up approach adopting chemical vapor transport. After comprehensive physical and chemical characterization, it was confirmed that the tellurene nanoflakes had a high crystallinity and environmental stability. The nanoflakes were transferred using the PDMS-assisted dry transfer method onto the end cap of the optical fiber with a high coverage over the core area. Benefiting from the nonlinear saturation absorption property of tellurene, stable passive Q-switched laser pulses were achieved in the communication band with a center wavelength of 1558 nm and pulse duration of 1. 44 μs. The repetition frequency was adjustable from 87 to 133 kHz. The results extend the application scenarios of novel tellurene nanomaterials and provide a potential pathway to obtaining tunable pulsed lasers. © 2023 Science Press.

It has numerous applications in nanotechnology, including electrochemical exfoliation, which involves the use of natural graphite foils, sheets, or rods. Ion intercalations increase the interlayer gap in the electrochemical exfoliation of graphite, producing pure graphene in monolayer or multilayer forms using chemical vapor deposition and pulsed laser deposition techniques. Electrochemical exfoliation techniques dope graphene materials, incorporate covalent functional groups, integrate nanoparticles, and assemble graphene structures. Compared to other processes, electrochemical exfoliation offers benefits such as simplicity, cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, high production rate, and high-quality few-layered graphene sheets. EG also provides a large sheet, less oxygen content, a high C/O ratio, and outstanding electrical characteristics. This chapter’s goal is to inform readers about the characteristics and applications of currently recognized electrochemically exfoliated multidimensional graphene structures, including graphene quantum dots (GQDs), one-dimensional (1D) graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) and graphene fibers (GFs), two-dimensional (2D) graphene nanomeshes (GNMs), rippled/wrinkled graphene, and 2D graphene membranes (GMs) and three-dimensional graphene (3DG) architectures made of graphene oxide (GO) and reduced GO (rGo) and highlight their unique properties which are based on the configuration of carbon atoms. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2024.","Character; Electrochemical; Exfoliated; Multilayered graphene","Chemical vapor deposition; Cost effectiveness; Graphite; Monolayers; Nanoribbons; Pulsed laser deposition; Semiconductor quantum dots; Atomic layer; Carbon-based; Character; Electrochemicals; Exfoliated; Graphite foils; Ion intercalation; Multi-layered graphene; Natural graphite; Optical and mechanical properties; Graphene","S.

Within this category of materials, lattice materials are of particular interest since their periodicity offers repeatable – and thus predictable – behavior. In combination with the advancements in additive manufacturing technologies, these lattice materials can be highly customized for a desired response. In this paper, the crashworthiness of unique multi-layer, multi-topology (MLMT) lattices is investigated. First, the nylon-carbon fiber composite material properties within a developed numerical model were tuned based on strut orientation. Then, the response of single-layer and three-layer cubic and octet lattices was investigated, where all lattices were designed with a relative density of 30%. Following the characterization of single-topology lattices, the response of MLMT lattices were investigated. Stress-strain, efficiency-strain, and multiple crashworthiness parameter data was collected for all lattices to facilitate in the comparison of those lattices. It was found that, experimentally, the unique MLMT lattices did not absorb more energy than their constituent layers combined, though modifications to the interface between layers could increase the energy absorption capability; the prediction of energy absorption of the MLMT lattices based on constituent layers was similar to actual numerical results. As all lattices were designed at the same relative density, the mass-specific energy absorption of the cubic-octet-cubic MLMT lattice (1.56 x103 J/kg) outperforms the single-topology octet lattice by 19% to 36% (1.15–1.31 x103 J/kg). While the octet-cubic-octet MLMT lattice (0.71 x103 J/kg) is outperformed by the single-topology cubic lattices (1.69–3.76 x103 J/kg), they see an increase of 59% to 77% in plateau stress (5.1–9.2 MPa) as compared to the MLMT lattice (2.1 MPa). © The Author(s) 2024.","cellular materials; composite filament; Energy absorption performance; experimental techniques; finite element analysis; fused filament fabrication","3D printing; Carbon fibers; Crashworthiness; Energy absorption; Polyamides; Rayon; Topology; Absorption performance; Cellular material; Composite filament; Energy absorption performance; Experimental techniques; Finite element analyse; Fused filament fabrication; Lattice materials; Multi topologies; Multi-layers; Finite element method","M.S.A.

Based on the 3D printing trajectories, a new numerical scheme to predict the elastic responses and behaviours of the 3D printed CCF/PA composite grids was developed. To verify the design and the numerical model, specifically created shearing tests were performed. By comparison, the modelled data agrees well with the experiments. Reinforced by CCFs, the effective shear modulus of 3D printed PA specimens was found to increase by 641.3%, 437.6% and 723% for basic structural configurations with material volume fractions of 20 vol-%, 40 vol-% and 60 vol-%, respectively. Even more, an index for evaluating the CCF reinforcement efficiency, independent of the design of the reinforced structure, was proposed and applied, indicating that the effective shear modulus can be maximally enhanced by 40.5 MP once the CCF volume content is increased by 1%.

Two different materials are considered, one with isotropic properties (nylon) and another one with orthotropic properties (onyx, which is nylon reinforced with chopped carbon fibres). The framework optimises, in the same particular sub-step, first the topology, and second, the fibre angle at every element throughout the domain. For the isotropic material, only topology optimisation takes place, whereas, for the orthotropic solid, both topology and fibre orientation are considered. The objective function is to minimise compliance, and this is done for three volume fractions of material inside the design domain: 30%, 40%, and 50%. Two classical benchmark cases are considered: 3-point and 4-point bending loading cases. The optimum topologies are further treated and manufactured using the fused filament fabrication (FFF) 3D printing method. Key results reveal that the absolute stiffness, density-normalised and volume-normalised stiffness values within each admissible volume are higher for onyx than for nylon, which proves the efficiency of the proposed concurrent optimisation framework. Moreover, although the objective function was to minimise compliance, it was also effective to improve the strength of all parts. The excellent quality and geometric tolerance of the 3D-printed parts are also worth mentioning. © 2022 The Authors","Additive manufacturing; Concurrent optimisation; Material optimisation; Topology optimisation","Fiber reinforced plastics; Polyamides; Rayon; Stiffness; Topology; Concurrent optimization; Fiber angles; Fibre orientation; Fibre-reinforced composite; Isotropic property; Material optimization; Objective functions; Optimisations; Optimization framework; Topology optimisation; 3D printers","J.H.S.

The study compared the effectiveness of three strengthening procedures using carbon or glass fibre-reinforced fabric materials on masonry vaults under different loads, aiming to determine the most effective procedure, material type, and amount. Results showed that the intrados strengthening procedure was more effective than the extrados, and carbon fibre-reinforced fabric material was generally more effective than glass fibre-reinforced fabric material.

The influence of nano particles on fracture toughness (KIC), energy (GIIC), thermal mechanical properties (DMA), and curing behaviors were investigated. Both KIC and GIIC were increased after the addition of nano fillers. The improvement of GIIC was different by the nano carbon fillers Topology. The dispersion and enhancement effect improved as nano particle dimensions decreased. The mechanisms of these improvements in toughness were explored using optical microscopy (OM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was revealed that the improvement of fracture toughness with addition of nano particles was due to debonding and deformation of the nano particles. Subsequently, the crack growth was hindered by the nano particles, and the stress energy at crack tip was released by crack deflections, particles deformation and particles rupture. Finally, the curing behavior of the epoxy resin with different types of nano particles were studied using DSC.

We have introduced a bottom-up reinforcement strategy for CFRP composites that involves modifying the bismaleimide resin matrix through the design of its molecular structure. This research utilized the Wittig olefination reaction to convert the polar carbonyl on the bismaleimide monomer to allyl, which resulted in a change in the cross-linked network topology of the bismaleimide resin matrix, and achieved a significant increase in mechanical properties. The tensile modulus of the modified bismaleimide resin matrix reached 5.59 GPa and the mechanism behind this enhancement is discussed in detail. This work is particularly significant due to the preparation and performance evaluation of CF/bismaleimide composites. The compressive strength and interlaminar shear strength of CF/bismaleimide composites showed noticeable improvements of 30.08% and 22.23% respectively, indicating that increasing the modulus of the resin matrix is an effective strategy for enhancing the compressive and interfacial properties of the composite material.

New design approaches such as topology optimization (TO) and structural optimization using lattice structures are possible. Pilot projects in the housing industry show that possible applications, in this case concrete AM, are also conceivable in the context of construction processes. This paper deals with the production of thin-walled concrete structures and shows material-related reduction potentials compared to conventional prefabricated concrete components. To this end, various extrudable high-performance mortars, some with fiber admixtures, have been developed and an appropriate standardised test specimen has been designed. On the basis of numerous material tests, it was possible to derive significant statements about the application limits of the developed materials, which are fundamental for the design of topo-logically optimised cross-sections of concrete components. The aim of this research project in the field of concrete AM is to produce segmentally built flexural beams and to investigate their load-bearing capacity. The test beams consist of several segments, each with a concrete formulation and a 3D design adapted to its calculated stresses. The segments themselves are manufactured without any classical reinforcement elements and are joined together after the manufacturing process with the application of prestressing with or without subsequent bonding. The segments can also be CO2 cured in an accelerated process prior to prestressing to further improve the material properties and to further reduce the environmental footprint through CO2 storage. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CO<sub>2</sub> Curing; Concrete AM; Topology Optimization","","M.-P.

However, the precise roles of DNT in the enhancement of thermomechanical properties are unknown. Here, the role of DNT with various topological structures on the glass transition temperature (Tg) of polymeric materials and the underlying mechanism of glass-rubber transition are identified utilizing molecular dynamics simulation. Interaction mechanism is discussed through density functional theory, which reveals influence of DNT topological structures on the instantaneous dipole at interface between DNT and adjacent polymer chains. Our results demonstrate that DNT with different topological structures processes variability in the enhancement of thermomechanical properties to the polymeric materials, which is related to rigidness, the dihedral angle between DNT and aromatic ring in the polymer chain, and the different mechanical interlock. The transition from glass to rubber is induced by increases in intermolecular motions, which is brought by increases in free volume at interface that are ruled by van der Waals interaction. It is also found that DNT significantly improves the Tg of epoxy nanocomposite more than other carbon-based nanoadditives.

Research on disordered carbon has recently unveiled intriguing carbon phases, particularly amorphous graphite, which possesses unique mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties due to its inherent topological defects. In this study, we employed ReaxFF-MD simulations to investigate the carbonization reactions and high-temperature graphitization process of an oxygenated polar aromatic precursor, anthrone. These simulations effectively captured the molecular processes involved in high-temperature reaction mechanisms, providing valuable insights into the underlying chemistry, reaction pathways of volatile molecules, and structural properties of the final product. We monitored the removal rate and percentage of noncarbon-containing volatile gases as indicators of the transition from carbonization to graphitization processes and studied the evolution of all carbon ring structures. Interestingly, we found that the final graphitic phase exhibited clusters of noncontinuous graphitic layers consisting of pentagons, heptagons, and hexagons. The structure can be classified as amorphous graphite. Puckering was observed near the pentagon-heptagon-hexagon network, resulting in corrugation between the layers. The novelty of this work lies in developing insights into the mechanistic details of the formation of amorphous graphite from a polar aromatic feedstock. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the carbonization and graphitization processes and can guide the optimization of synthesis techniques for amorphous graphite materials with tailored properties. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","","Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Carbonization; Electronic properties; Feedstocks; Graphitization; Carbon phase; Carbonisation; Crystalline arrangement; Disordered carbon; Graphite formation; Graphitization process; MD simulation; Mechanistics; Partially crystalline; Topological defect; Graphite","M.M.

Longitudinal tensile strengths of CC-AM have been reported exceeding 1500 MPa with minimal porosity, making this system available for structural applications. However, there remain a number of morphological non-idealities that are unique to the CC-AM process that challenge the performance of a complex AM build. These can be categorized into material non-idealities (fiber clustering, resin-rich zones, matrix quality) and topological constraint non-idealities (joint design constraints, minimum path radius, tow cuts). Furthermore, for UV snap-cured carbon fiber CC-AM, limited penetration of the incident UV through the carbon fiber tow presents a challenge to optimal in-situ curing. The present work lays out these challenges, with specific case examples for material built with the CF3D system (Continuous Composites Inc.) using T-1100 12K carbon fiber tows and a UV snap curing acrylate resin. Most of the issues highlighted are inherent to CC-AM, so the recommendations for future development to mitigate the various non-idealities are expected to translate to other CC-AM technologies, such as those using a thermoplastic polymer. © 2023 Soc. for the Advancement of Material and Process Engineering.

Fiber-reinforced composites are characterized by lightweight, tough, and with high energy absorption capabilities, they have received considerable attentions. Honeycomb structure is one of the typical lightweight structures of fiber-reinforced composites, it features a two-dimensional polygon array with periodic topological organization in the plane, and brings technical challenges to fabricate fiber-reinforced composites. Herein, we present a novel acoustic-assisted 3D printing method to fabricate fiber-reinforced composites with simplified honeycomb structures. Firstly, the surface acoustic wave (SAW) assisted printing system was developed, and its working principle for fiber-reinforced composites printing was introduced. Both carbon fibers and carbon nanofibers can be patterned into fine patterning with the assistance of SAW-induced pressure fields. With a layer-by-layer process, fiber-reinforced composites with simplified honeycomb structures were successfully printed. The compression tests showed that the specific energy absorption of the fiber-reinforced composite was about 168 J/kg and its ultimate stress was 1840 kPa, these values were 75.0 % and 102 % higher than that of the pure resin printed structures, respectively.

The novelty is that the tubes are reinforced in critical areas using strip composite patches to provide a topology-optimized tube, and their damage mechanisms and mechanical performance are compared to that of un-reinforced (reference) tubes. To detect the types of damage mechanisms and their progression, the Acoustic Emission (AE) method is employed, accompanied by data clustering analysis. The loading conditions are simulated using the finite element method, and the results are validated through experimental testing. The findings confirm that the inclusion of reinforcing patches improves the stress distribution, leading to enhanced load carrying capacity, stiffness, and energy absorption. Compared to the reference tubes, the reinforced tubes exhibit a remarkable increase of 23.25% in the load carrying capacity, 33.46% in the tube’s stiffness, and 23.67% in energy absorption. The analysis of the AE results reveals that both the reference and reinforced tubes experience damage mechanisms such as matrix cracking, fiber-matrix debonding, delamination, and fiber fracture. However, after matrix cracking, delamination becomes dominant in the reinforced tubes, while fiber failure prevails in the reference tubes. Moreover, by combining the AE energy and mechanical energy using the Sentry function, it is observed that the reinforced tubes exhibit a lower rate of damage propagation, indicating superior resistance to damage propagation compared to the reference tubes. © 2023 by the authors.","acoustic emission; composite tube; damage mechanisms; filament winding; strip patch","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Clustering algorithms; Cracks; Energy absorption; Failure (mechanical); Fibers; Filament winding; Load limits; Loads (forces); Thin walled structures; Tubes (components); Acoustic-emissions; Composite tube; Damage mechanism; Damage propagation; Fibre-reinforced composite; Filament wound; Matrix cracking; Mechanical behavior; Mechanical damages; Strip patch; Stiffness","M.

Lightweight sandwich cores with bio-inspired topologies have been used as an advanced alternative to conventional bulk cores to improve performance. Nowadays, sandwich structures comprised of core and skins are typically manufactured with two different processes and are afterwards adhesively joined together. Here, with a less time-consuming and more efficient assembly procedure in mind, an integrally 3D-printing strategy is proposed. This investigation analyses the low-velocity impact and quasi-static perforation performance of sandwich core designs inspired by the beetle's forewing trabecular structure. It was found that the core material was responsible of the rate dependence observed in the force–displacement curves.

However, the weakest points of these structures use to be the joints. For this reason, in the last years, many studies have dealt with joining technologies for dissimilar materials. The Reinforce3D’s Continuous Fibre Injection Process (CFIP) technology delivers a unique method to join dissimilar materials. CFIP is based on injecting continuous fibers, such as carbon fibers, simultaneously with liquid resin into tubular cavities within the part. Then the resin is cured and the final composite part is obtained. This work focuses on the characterization of the mechanical properties of CFIP-made specimens and describes the potential lightweight benefits of the technology. Mechanical tests were performed under tensile and bending conditions following standardized methods. The lightweight potential is addressed by developing a representative case study by implementing finite element and topology optimization methods. The results of this case study were finally compared with a monomaterial equivalent component (aluminium) demonstrating the improvement that CFIP provides in terms of lightweight while keeping the strength. © 2024, Association of American Publishers.

One of the technologies currently pursued by some companies is high-speed electric motors. For instance, the new Model S Plaid motor by Tesla has a carbon-fiber wrapped IPM (Interior Permanent Magnet) rotor which can exceed 20,000rpm. The SPX88-120 made by Helix company shows a power density of about 18kW/kg at 50,000rpm. However, such high rotating speeds result is huge mechanical stresses in the entire rotating assembly, thus making the structural design of these parts extremely challenging. The primary goal of this paper is to provide a scientific rationale for the effective Finite Element Modeling (FEM) and integration strategies to maximize the rotating assembly durability of a 150kW radial flux SPMSM (surface-mounted permanent magnet synchronous motor) considered as a case-study. A non-linear simulation requires the input of a stress-strain curve and modified power law hardening study is conducted. The secondary goal of the paper is to analyze the thermal stress risers for multiphysics optimization of components. An analytical methodology to estimate the fatigue life for fully reverse cyclic loading is expressed. An extensive study on the eigen mode shape and frequency was performed to understand the dominant frequency of the system. A comparative performance study is conducted on shaft critical speeds, modal analysis, and stiffness interaction between components.

However, it is still unclear how the shape and size of MPL surface cracks affect the transmission of liquid water in GDL. Therefore, a three-dimensional volume of fluid (VOF) model is developed to study the relationship between MPL crack and GDL liquid water transport. First, the random direction method is used to reconstruct the carbon fiber layer of GDL, which is in good agreement with the experimental data. Secondly, the morphological changes of MPL are analyzed, and two kinds of cracks with different topological shapes are proposed. The parameters of crack area, width and depth of the numerical model are designed according to the MPL porosity. Finally, the relationship between MPL crack variation and liquid water saturation/variation in GDL is investigated by numerical modeling. The results show that the shape, area, width and depth of MPL crack affect the water fraction in GDL. The impact of crack on the transfer path of liquid water in GDL is mainly in the early stage of water inflow. With the increase of water inflow, this impact is mainly related to the structure of GDL. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Crack; Gas diffusion layer; Microporous layer; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell; Two-phase flow","Carbon fibers; Diffusion in gases; Microporosity; Numerical models; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Three dimensional computer graphics; Transport properties; Gas diffusion layers; Gas-water; Liquid water; Microporous layers; Proton-exchange membranes fuel cells; Reactive gas; Shape and size; Two phases flow; Water inflows; Waters managements; Two phase flow","S.

Lightweight materials such as aluminum, magnesium, and fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composites can reduce the vehicle's structural mass, the body-in-white (BIW), by up to 50%. However, the higher proportion of large sports utility vehicles (SUVs) and trucks in the North American fleet poses a challenge, as the larger size and high production scale of the structural components for this segment can significantly increase material costs. Thus, a multi-material approach to deploy FRP composites at select locations in an existing metal BIW can help advance composites design, integration, and manufacturing technologies. Furthermore, these designs can be translated for future EV structures. This study utilizes a systems approach to 1) establish design targets through structural analysis of the baseline SUV BIW design under various static and dynamic load cases, 2) conceptualize multi-material designs, and 3) assess the designs to meet lightweighting, cost, and sustainability objectives. Sustainable recycled carbon fiber-reinforced composites and other cost-effective FRP composite materials manufactured using state-of-the-art high-pressure resin transfer molding (HP RTM) technology were assessed for use in structural elements. An ultrasonic additive manufacturing (UAM) technique was implemented to produce mechanically interlocked metal-fiber transition joints to serve as a joining mechanism between fibers and metals in the multi-material design. To incorporate the transition joint design into the topology optimization scheme, a high-fidelity model of the fiber-metal transition joints that describes the fiber-oriented interactions between the fibers, cured-epoxy matrix, and metal components was developed. This model's results accurately represented the behavior from experimental testing. They can be transferred to the FEA solver as a computationally efficient material card specifically for use at the metal-composite transition regions in the proposed designs. The results from this system-level multi-material composites integration study have been presented. Copyright © 2023. Used by CAMX - The Composites and Advanced Materials Expo.

Due to the promotion of renewable energy sources and the movement towards a low-carbon society, the practical usage of photovoltaic (PV) systems in conjunction with battery energy storage systems (BESS) has increased significantly in recent years. Based on the nanofabrication reported in this article, the major goal is to use the available wind and solar resources to produce power. Additionally, differences in optical power and received electrical power are replicated by variations in fibre length at a specified modulation frequency of 300 GHz. Max. Using HOMER software, a 6 kWp solar-wind hybrid system put on the roof of a school is investigated and optimised at various degrees of dependability. Investigations are made on the techno-economic characteristics of real and ideal hybrid system topologies with maximum capacity shortfalls of 0%, 5%, 10%, and 20%. The impact of a capacity deficit on overall net present costs and surplus power generation is examined via a hybrid system's sensitivity analysis. It is demonstrated that a 2 kWp PV system with one string of ten 12 V batteries is more economical than the current system, which has a COE of $0.575/kWh. The most effective design for utilising the site's solar and wind resources is demonstrated to be a 5 kWp wind turbine, a 2 kWp PV system, and battery storage. The results demonstrate that hybrid solar-wind energy systems may effectively utilise renewable energy sources for distributed applications.

Inspired by diatoms that exhibit prominent mechanical strength, corrosion resistance, and ultraviolet (UV) aging resistance owing to the protection of the silicon-oxygen framework, silication-oxidation modification of FRPC was performed to achieve multi-functionalisation in a simple and high-efficiency manner. Specifically, a continuous basalt-fibres fabric was used as a continuous framework for the composite to mimic the inorganic silica that constitutes diatoms, and a novel epoxy silicate resin consisting of organic silicon and carbon chains is synthesised via a topological strategy as the body of the composite, which is similar to the organic matter in diatoms. Interestingly, with the construction of diatom-like components and structures as well as the regulation of the thermosetting network topology, the performance of the resin matrix and interface is enhanced, thus endowing the composite with outstanding strength, toughness, corrosion resistance, UV-aging resistance, and flame retardancy. This diatom-inspired silication–oxidation strategy provides a simple and efficient method for preparing a multifunctional FRPC for application in the fields of shipbuilding and ocean engineering. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Bionics design; Interface; Multifunctional properties; Network topology; Polymer-matrix composites","Corrosion resistance; Epoxy resins; Heat resistance; Impact strength; Organic carbon; Oxidation; Phytoplankton; Polymer matrix composites; Reinforcement; Resins; Seawater corrosion; Silica; Silicates; Silicones; Ageing resistance; Bionic design; Fiber reinforced epoxy composites; Fiber-reinforced polymeric composites; Flame-retardancy; Multi-functionalization; Multifunctional properties; Network topology; Simple++; Ultraviolet aging; Network topology","P.

Although hybrid components provide a combination of advantages from the constituent materials, there are some challenges for the manufacture of high-quality hybrid components, including weak interface bonding between the constituent materials. This research focuses on utilising additive manufacturing (AM) technology to control an aluminium substrate's surface features to enhance interfacial bonding with a CFRP laminate. For this purpose, different surface structures were designed and manufactured using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) technology to understand the influence of surface geometry and roughness on the interface. A lattice structure with a unit cell size of 3 × 3 × 1.5 mm was manufactured to create a substrate surface with porosity. A second substrate surface was designed with the same lattice structure; however, the voids were filled to present an equivalent surface topology (EST), excluding porosity. This comparison provides an understanding of the influence of the porosity of the substrate surface on interfacial bonding strength. Interfacial bonding between the aluminium substrates and a CFRP laminate was assessed using short beam strength (SBS) and flatwise tensile tests. The results from the SBS testing indicated a 3D-printed substrate with random surface roughness increased the interlaminar shear strength of the hybrid component by almost 200% compared to a hybrid laminate with non-printed substrate. The results from flatwise tensile tests illustrated that the out-of-plane bonding strength can also be improved significantly (almost 100%). © 2023, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; CFRP; Hybrid composites; nTopology; Surface modification","3D printing; Additives; Aluminum; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Diffusion bonding; Hybrid composites; Industrial research; Shear strength; Substrates; Surface roughness; Tensile testing; Aluminum substrate; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Constituent materials; Hybrid component; Hybrid composites; Interfacial bonding; Interfacial bonding strength; Ntopology; Substrate surface; Surface-modification; Porosity","H.

To address this growing demand and enhance the overall performance of new ATV architectures, automakers are looking to develop new lightweight chassis designs with the application of multi-material parts, assemblies, and systems. To achieve these goals, conventional material selection and design strategies may be employed, such as standard material performance indices, full-combinatorial substitution studies, or recently developed multi-material topology optimization (MMTO). In this paper, a prototype design for a lightweight eATV chassis using titanium, aluminium, and carbon fibre sheet moulding compound is developed using a novel design process. The design space for the MMTO design is developed from the baseline steel chassis design. The proposed design process reduces the time required to design an eATV chassis significantly as it reduces the number of design update iterations by efficiently modelling the material interface. The process utilizes MMTO considering total joint cost (TJC) constraints to refine the chassis design and reduce the material interface. This method allows for simultaneously minimizing the compliance as well as restricting the TJC of the structure which is calculated based on the user-defined relative costs for each material interface. This reduces the number of iterations between design update and validation as the performance of the prototype design would be more in line with the design considering actual joint material properties than considering the MMTO design without TJC constraint. A Pareto front is created to determine the trade-off between the two competing functions. It was observed that an 80% reduction in TJC can be obtained in the eATV chassis design with only a 4.2% loss in stiffness, as compared to an MMTO design without joint considerations. Both this final design and the single-material topology optimization (SMTO) design considering titanium were reinterpreted into a practical concept and analysed. The final selected MMTO design is 32% lighter than the baseline steel chassis design, with a stiffness increase of 64%. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Automotive; Dissimilar materials; Electric ATV; Joint cost; Manufacturability; Material interface; Multi-material topology optimization; Pseudo-cost domain","Design; Dissimilar materials; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Hybrid materials; Interfaces (materials); Stiffness; Topology; Automotives; Chassis design; Electric ATV; Joint cost; Manufacturability; Material interfaces; Multi materials; Multi-material topology optimization; Pseudo-cost domain; Topology optimisation; Greenhouse gases","I.Y.

Recently, the development of fiber-based artificial muscles based on fibrous twisting structure has provided new ways and effective methods for new development of the smart textiles. Fiber-based artificial muscles show sensitive and rapid actuating response to external stimuli based on the mechanism of anisotropic volume expansion. The current research aims to show that man-made fibers (e.g., carbon nanotubes, graphene, and shape memory alloys) and natural fibers (such as silk, spider silk, and cotton) can be used to prepare twisted fiber-based glexible actuators. However, the current fiber-based artificial muscles generally suffer from high cost, harsh stimulation conditions, chemical toxicity or complex manufacturing processes, which hinder the wide applications of fiber-based artificial muscles. Therefore, it is necessary to develop fiber-based artificial muscles with mild and moisture-response, high actuating response, stable actuating performance and low cost based on the use of environment-friendly fiber materials to promote the applications of the yarn muscles as a type of smart textiles. Method A cross-scale processing strategy was harnessed to process viscose fibers into high-performance artificial yarn muscles. With the help of nano-micro structure regulation of fiber and the inherent multi-hierarchical structure designability, scalability, softness and mechanical robustness of textiles, the bottom-up textile configuration technology and stress engineering methods were used to develop a moisture-responsive artificial yarn muscle actuator with rapid response and large actuating strain. Furthermore, through the topological weaving/knitting configuration, the one-dimensional deformation of the yarn actuator was expected to extend to a fabric actuator with sizable dimension and multiple deformations. A large-scale processing method was to be identified for the formation of yarn and fabric actuators, so as to facilitate the design and development of smart textiles with moisture-response. Results When alternatively exposed to dry and wet conditions, the artificial yarn muscles were found to be able to produce reversible torsional rotation. By applying water fog of 0.05 g/s to actuate the artificial muscles, the muscles demonstrated encouraging actuating performance. The maximum rotation degree of the hot-drawn artificial yarn muscles reached 1 657 (°)/cm, which is 1.7 times higher than that of the artificial yarn muscles prepared from the original viscose fibers without hot-drawn treatments, with an average speed of 331 r/min, exceeding the original viscose artificial yarn muscle (254 r/min). Through the integration of spinning technology and topological textile design, the mechanized production of artificial yarn muscles was achieved, and the fabric artificial muscle actuators were developed and fabricated, extending the simple deformation of the one-dimensional artificial yarn muscles to the high-dimensional diversified deformation in two-dimensional fabric artificial muscles. Conclusion This paper proposes a cross-scale design strategy from micro structure (fiber aggregated structure) to macro configuration (fiber-yarn-fabric structure) to prepare moisture-responsive fiber-based artificial muscles with high actuating strain.

Particularly, prestressed concrete members reinforced with such polymeric materials are becoming popular to evade corrosion-related issues. The conventional simply supported bridge requires bearings and expansion joints for various load transfers, mandating regular maintenance and protection from corrosion. The corrosion-related distress and additional joints directly or indirectly reduce the bridge life and increase the cost as well as maintenance activities. To avoid such challenges, the present study proposes the design of an integral bridge with reinforced and prestressed fiber-reinforced composite tendons alternative to the traditional simply supported bridge reinforced with corrosion-prone steel rebars. Herein, the Strut-and-Tie Modeling (STM) approach is followed for the analysis of the integral bridge members. Furthermore, the design of the integral bridge based on the STM approach is compared with the traditional limit state design approach. A full-scale three-dimensional (3D) Finite Element (FE) model of a CFRP composite-reinforced single-span integral bridge is developed. Stress field analysis is performed corresponding to Ultimate Limit State (ULS) combinations as per the EN 1990 Eurocode. Also, topology optimization of an idealized portal frame of the bridge is performed for the applied vertical loading on the structure. The optimized truss topology has proven helpful in reducing computational cost and time requirements using the STM approach. © 2023, Structural Engineering Research Centre.

Biological structures are considered to be optimized, since evolution influenced the shape and topology of the structure over a long time span. The main driving force is the adaption to the boundary conditions present in the environment of the biological system. Therefore, many optimization procedures are contained in the growth processes, resulting in the final shape and topology of the biological structure. The accumulation of matter in the system with the resulting spatial expansion can be described by continuum mechanics. The insights gained by this approach allow for a precise description and three-dimensional modeling of the biological structure. The obtained growth formulations can be applied independently of the utilized material model. As a consequence, the growth formulations can be applied to engineering challenges within numerical simulations to obtain biologically inspired designs for engineering structures. In civil engineering, a new and promising material, which is still researched frequently, is carbon fiber reinforced concrete. This material allows for a reduction of concrete required in engineering designs. Therefore, the obtained formulations are employed for carbon fiber reinforced concrete structures, since new design approaches for this material are required. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biomechanics; Bionics; Carbon Reinforced Concrete; Continuum Mechanics; Growth Modeling","Biological systems; Biomimetics; Bionics; Continuum mechanics; Fiber reinforced materials; Structural design; Topology; Biological structures; Biologically-inspired; Carbon fiber reinforced concrete; Carbon reinforced concrete; Driving forces; Engineering challenges; Growth models; Growth process; Optimization procedures; Time span; Reinforced concrete","M.

Specifically, four types of core geometries including circular, hexagonal, square, and triangular were investigated. Sandwich structures were fabricated using Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) 3D printing method using polylactic acid (PLA) and carbon fiber reinforced polylactic acid (CF-PLA). The material properties of PLA and CF-PLA were determined via tensile test. Three-point bending tests were performed to achieve the energy absorption performance of sandwich structures. The findings of the bending test show that the core topology has a substantial impact on sandwich constructions' capacity to absorb energy. In particular, the EA value of the sandwich structure with a circular core is %111, %106, and %449 higher compared to sandwich structures with hexagonal, square, and triangular core geometries, respectively. Additionally, it has been observed that the use of different materials affects the energy absorption capacity of sandwich structures. The SEA values of sandwich structures manufactured from circular and hexagonal core geometries of PLA material are approximately 3.1 and 1.5 times higher, respectively, compared to sandwich structures manufactured from CF-PLA material.

Biomaterial-based nerve conduits are increasingly recognized as a potential alternative to nerve autografts for the treatment of peripheral nerve injury. However, an ideal nerve conduit must offer topological guidance and biochemical and electrical signal transduction mechanisms. In this work, aligned conductive nanofibrous scaffolds comprising polylactic-co-glycolic acid and multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) were fabricated via coaxial electrospinning, and nerve growth factor (NGF) and Lycium barbarum polysaccharides (LBP) purified from the wolfberry were loaded on the core and shell layers of the nanofibers, respectively. LBP were confirmed to accelerate long-distance axon regeneration after severe peripheral nerve injury. In addition, the synergistic promotion of LBP and NGF on nerve cell proliferation and neurite outgrowth was demonstrated. MWCNTs were introduced into the aligned fibers to further increase the electrical conductivity, which promoted the directional growth and neurite extension of neurons in vitro. Further, the combination of conductive fibrous scaffolds with electrical stimulation that mimics endogenous electric fields significantly promoted the differentiation of PC12 cells and the axon outgrowth of neurons. Based on robust cell-induced behaviors, conductive composite fibers with optimized fiber alignment may be used for the promotion of nerve recovery. © The Author(s) 2023.

Our theoretical predictions quantitatively agree well with previous tests, and the influence of interfacial energy and modulus of films on toughness enhancement is considered. Our findings have demonstrated that aligned CNTs play a crucial role in enhancing delamination resistance, with the performance being highly sensitive to their volume fraction, mechanical properties, and geometric characteristics. We optimized interlaminar toughness by selecting appropriate strength and aspect ratio of CNTs based on two competitive failure modes.

As a result, several types of metal-composite joints have been manufactured using different methods, with the 3D metal anchor solution attracting significant attention. This study evaluates different anchor geometries applied to single lap joints through preliminary finite element method (FEM) simulations and experimental validation on joints between CFRP and Inconel 625 produced via a laser beam powder bed fusion (LB-PBF) additive process. The models proposed increase in complexity. The homogenization process is employed to determine the equivalent properties of the joint region that is occupied by metal anchors and CFRP. The model also supports topology parametrization to assess the impact of anchor geometry on structural properties.

Here, thiol-terminated hyperbranched polyimides (DSPI-n) were synthesized by a newly designed imide monomer and then were covalently grafted onto the surface of pristine carbon fiber fabric (PCF) by a thiol-ene click reaction to produce thiol-functionalized carbon fiber fabric (TCF). Then, the degradable imide skeleton hyperbranched epoxy resin (DIHE-n) was synthesized from DSPI-n by a click reaction to prepare the DIHE-n/TCF composites. Compared with the DIHE-n/PCF composites, the tensile strength, interlaminar shear strength, and interfacial shear strength of the DIHE-n/TCF composites were distinctly increased, explained by an interfacial strengthening mechanism, being attributed to a synergistic effect of the wide interface layer, strong load transfer capacity of the deformable hyperbranched topological structure, and mechanical interlock of double crosslinked structure. Moreover, the prepared composites can be completely degraded under mild conditions and the carbon fiber fabric can be intactly recycled. This study offers a new approach for the preparation of recyclable and high-performance EP/CF composites. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon fibers; Composites; Epoxy resin; Hyperbranched polymers; Interface; Recycling","Dendrimers; Epoxy resins; Recycling; Shear flow; Shear strength; Tensile strength; Wind power; Carbon fiber fabrics; Fabric composites; Functionalized; Hyperbranched epoxy resin; Hyperbranched polymers; Interface strengthening; Interfacial strengthening; Pristine carbon; Recycling; Synthesised; Carbon fibers","D.

Floor slabs show high potential for saving materials and CO2 emissions, as they account for around 50% of the total volume of concrete used worldwide. A promising approach is the use of corrosion-resistant carbon fibre-reinforced polymer (CFRP) reinforcement, which requires only a small concrete cover to meet bond requirements. Regarding the component’s topology, material-efficient ribbed or waffle slabs have been built for decades but their execution has declined owing to their labour-intense production, which calls for manual installation of the formwork. A recently proposed extrusion manufacturing process combines both approaches for material-minimised construction and allows the fast and formwork-free production of carbon reinforced concrete (CRC) components. This article describes the concept, the finding of the form, fabrication and experimental testing of an innovative ribbed floor slab composed of precast extruded carbon reinforced concrete (ExCRC) webs. The novel floor slab consists of a conventionally cast thin-walled top slab and shaped, load-adapted ExCRC webs to achieve high utilisaton of the structural member. The ribbed slab provides a lightweight structural system with drastic savings in dead load compared with a conventional steel reinforced slab. In addition, the high durability and service life of the novel floor slabs makes them ideal components to be recovered after an initial life cycle and to be re-used in new construction projects. The paper gives an outlook to the full-scale production of one-way and two-way slab systems made of ExCRC such as ribbed slabs, waffle slabs and sandwich slabs with a honeycomb infill. © 2023 by the authors.","CFRP; CRC; extrusion; material-minimised components; ribbed slab; sandwich slab with honeycomb infill; waffle slab","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Carbon footprint; Construction industry; Corrosion resistance; Extrusion; Floors; Honeycomb structures; Infill drilling; Life cycle; Thin walled structures; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Carbon reinforced concrete; Floor slabs; Formwork; Lightweight building elements; Material-minimized component; New constructions; Ribbed slabs; Sandwich slab with honeycomb infill; Waffle slabs; Reinforced concrete","S.

For short carbon fiber (SCF) conductive polymer composites (SCFCPCs), the electrical properties and SCF conductive network topology of SCFCPCs with different SCF orientations are analyzed with a numerical model. The results demonstrate that an increase in the degree of SCF orientation from 0 (SCFs perpendicular to conductivity direction) to 1 (SCFs parallel to conductivity direction) first leads to a corresponding increase and then a decrease in the electrical conductivity of SCFCPCs. The highest electrical conductivity is achieved while the degree of SCF orientation is increased to approximately 0.6, which is a higher SCF orientation state compared to random orientation. Moreover, it is identified that more SCFs in conductive networks do not necessarily guarantee a higher electrical conductivity. The electrical conductivity of the SCF conductive networks also depends on the degree of SCF orientation. Evidently, the less-oriented SCFs tend to build in-layer conductive networks, while the highly oriented SCFs tend to build interlayer ones, which apply a greater contribution to the electrical conductivity. Overall, the results of this study reveal why the highest electrical conductivity occurs at a higher SCF orientation rather than a random SCF orientation. The clarified influence and mechanism provide indications for the electrical conductivity regulation of micro/nanocomposites by adjusting the conductive filler orientation. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","conductive composites; electrical properties; filler orientation; mechanism analysis; short carbon fiber","Carbon fibers; Electric conductivity; Filled polymers; Fillers; Network layers; Conductive composites; Conductive networks; Conductive polymer composites; Electrical conductivity; Fibre orientation; Filler orientation; High electrical conductivity; Mechanism analysis; Short carbon fibers; Simulation studies; Topology","K.

However, current upper-limb exoskeletons in the market would have issues such as user discomfort and inconvenience, and high costs for individual customers. This paper introduces a new chain-based cable-driven upper-limb exoskeleton that is lightweight, cost-effective, and comfortable for the wearer in various movements. It focuses explicitly on three degrees of freedom (DOFs) actuated by foldable chain mechanisms: flexion-extension and abduction-adduction for the shoulder joint and flexion-extension for the elbow joint. The exoskeleton's structure is fabricated using lightweight and printable materials, such as Thermoplastic Polyurethane (TPU), Polyethylene Terephthalate Glycol (PETG), and carbon fiber. A compact control system consisting of high-torque DC motors, microcontroller, and cable-driven mechanism was meticulously selected to optimize the device size. Moreover, stress analysis and topology optimization simulations are conducted to minimize weight and ensure the exoskeleton's functionality while maintaining a safety factor of 2. This prototype has a total weight of 15 lbs. Experimental studies were performed to evaluate the exoskeleton's range of motion for shoulder abduction-adduction and elbow extension with up to 33 Nm torque. Overall, this new chain-based upper-limb exoskeleton exhibits promise as an affordable and comfortable rehabilitation tool for individuals with upper limb impairments. © 2024 IEEE.","","Cables; Carbon fibers; Cost effectiveness; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Electric connectors; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Joints (anatomy); Plastic bottles; Safety factor; Stress analysis; Abduction/adduction; Assistive technology; Cable-driven; Flexion-extension; Mechanical analysis; Mechanical development; Motor disability; Recovery process; Rehabilitation technology; Upper limbs; DC motors","M.

MOFs featuring above characteristics demonstrate promising prospects for a category of crucial fields such as catalyst, energy-storage, and separation, especially in energy-storage system. However, due to the diversity of pores in MOF materials, it is difficult to take full advantage of the MOF materials to react with electrolyte ions during the charging and discharging process. Herein, by choosing different ligands, a DHTP-Ni-MOF nanoflower arrays (NFAs) with high specific surface area and large pore size were successfully directly grown on carbon nanotube fiber (CNTF) as the cathode to construct a high-performance fiber-shaped aqueous rechargeable (FAR) Ni//Zn batteries. Profiting the superiorities of the DHTP-Ni-MOF, the DHTP-Ni-MOF NFAs/CNTF electrode can deliver an ultrahigh capacity of 0.47 mAh cm−2 at a high current density of 4 mA cm−2, and demonstrate an excellent rate capability (0.32 mAh cm−2 at 80 mA cm−2). Importantly, our assembled FAR Ni//Zn batteries exhibit an ultrahigh energy density of 215.01 mWh cm−3 at power density of 2.39 W cm−3.

To meet this need, thermoreversible epoxy matrices have been developed in recent years. This study investigates the performance of an epoxy vitrimer made by introducing a metal catalyst (Zn2+) and its carbon fibre composites, focusing on the healing capability of the system. The dynamic crosslinking networks endow vitrimers with interesting rheological behaviour; the capability of the formulated resin (AV-5) has been assessed by creep tests. The analysis showed increased molecular mobility above a topology freezing temperature (Tv). However, the reinforcement phase inhibits the flow capability, reducing the flow. The fracture behaviour of CFRP made with the vitrimeric resin has been investigated by Mode I and Mode II tests and compared with the conventional system. The repairability of the vitrimeric CFRP has been investigated by attempting to recover the delaminated samples, which yielded unsatisfactory results. Moreover, the healing efficiency of the modified epoxy composites has been assessed using the vitrimer as an adhesive layer. The joints were able to recover about 84% of the lap shear strength of the pristine system. © 2023 by the authors.","compression moulding; epoxy matrix; multifunctional composites; vitrimer","Adhesives; Carbon fibers; Catalysts; Efficiency; Environmental impact; Epoxy composites; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fracture mechanics; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Composite polymer; Epoxy; Epoxy matrices; Multifunctional composites; Performance; Thermoreversible; Vitrimer; Zn 2+; ]+ catalyst; Resins","F.

Concerns with such machines are that the overall rotating assembly experiences significant mechanical loads due to the rapid rotational speeds, making it exceptionally challenging to design the structural integrity of these components. This study's main objective is to offer a scientific justification for designing an integrated rotor hub and shaft through efficient Finite Element Modeling (FEM) and integration strategies to maximize the rotating assembly durability of a 150kW radial flux SPMSM spinning at 20,000 rpm. The optimization of integrated topology is evaluated based on a multiphysics platform, along with studies conducted on motor assembly eigen frequency. The integrated approach combining the shaft and rotor hub made of AISI 4340 solely saves 1.84kg, removing the necessity of standard components such as balancing end clamp plates, locknuts, and washers. Lower masses are proportional to lower centrifugal forces, reducing radial stress and promoting component/assembly stiffness.  © 2023 IEEE.","Carbon fiber sleeve; eigen analysis; finite element analysis; high-speed machines; motor design; PMSM; radial flux machines; SPMsm; stress engineering","Balancing; Finite element method; Permanent magnets; Spinning (fibers); Structural design; Synchronous motors; Carbon fiber sleeve; Eigen analysis; Finite element analyse; High speed machine; Motor design; PMSM; Radial-flux machines; Rotor hubs; SPMsm; Stress engineering; Carbon fibers","A.

Load transfer within these materials can be attributed to a combination of cohesion, static friction, covalent cross-links, and entanglements. Of these mechanisms, entanglements are the least studied or understood and are not well defined when applied to nanotube materials. In this work, an entanglement is defined with sufficient detail for molecular models to be built and tested. Non-reactive models where the covalent bond topology does not change and reactive models where covalent bonds can form and break were developed. In both model types, entanglement load transfer was observed and can be attributed to buckles (i.e., wrinkles) that form under bending compression. In non-reactive models, there are energy barriers to restructure the shape of the buckles, while reactive models formed covalent bonds at the high-curvature edges of the buckles. Reactive models produced an average load transfer approximately 14 times greater than non-reactive models due to these covalent bonds. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","carbon nanotube; entanglement; load transfer; mechanics; molecular dynamics; nanotube network; ReaxFF; structural materials","Covalent bonds; Molecular dynamics; Aerospace structure; Entanglement; Lightweight materials; Load transfer; Materials class; Nanotube assemblies; Nanotube networks; Reactive modelling; Reaxff; Static friction; Carbon nanotubes","B.D.

However, traditional post-treatment methods for magnetic carbon-based aerogels often face difficulties in maintaining aerogel structure, regulating the content of magnetic components, and dispersing magnetic particles. Herein, we first induce a topological deformation of bulky Ni-MOF particles to generate Ni-MOF aerogel assembled by crosslinked fibers, and then convert this intermediate aerogel to final Ni/C composite aerogels (NCCAs) through controllable high-temperature pyrolysis. This novel strategy achieves high loading and uniform dispersion of magnetic metal nanoparticles throughout carbon skeleton. Pyrolysis temperature plays a very important role to determine the overall attenuation capability and impedance matching of NCCAs, because it has a remarkable impact on the dielectric loss of carbon skeleton but negligible effect on magnetic loss. When the temperature is 700 °C, the optimum product (NCCA-2) will show the best EM absorption performance among this series of composites, including strong reflection loss and broad effective absorption bandwidth. Surprisingly, the integrated advantages of aerogel structure and MOFs transformation not only render NCCA-2 as a highly competitive candidate for high-performance EWAMs as compared with various Ni/C composites, but also bestow it on excellent hydrophobic and thermal insulation properties. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Electromagnetic absorption; Hydrophobicity; Ni/C composite aerogels; Thermal insulation; Topological deformation","Carbon; Dielectric losses; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electromagnetic waves; Hydrophobicity; Metal nanoparticles; Musculoskeletal system; Nanomagnetics; Pyrolysis; Thermal insulation; Topology; Aerogel structures; Carbon skeleton; Carbon-based; Composite aerogel; Direct preparation; Magnetic carbons; Ni/C composite aerogel; Performance; Topological deformation; Wave absorbing materials; Aerogels","Y.

Herein, we experimentally investigate the influence of fiber–matrix interphase on the fracture toughness of fiber-reinforced composites. Carbon fiber is modified with nanoparticles having different physical and chemical features, including functionalized carbon nanotubes (fCNTs), cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), and hybrid CNC-CNT, and the effect of chemical and mechanical properties of the fiber–matrix interphase and fiber surface topology on the mode I and mode II delamination resistance of carbon fiber/epoxy composites is studied. The objective of this study is to fundamentally understand the relationship of fiber–matrix interphase properties and fracture toughness. It is observed that fiber–matrix interfacial strength depends on the width and chemical properties of the interphase zone. CNC-CNT spans the interfacial zone enhancing the interfacial strength by 76%, allowing the matrix to have a more effective contribution during the fracture. The stronger interphase subsequently results in 183% improvement in mode I and 75% improvement in mode II interlaminar fracture toughness of the composite. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fiber (A); Delamination (B); Fiber/matrix bond (B); Mechanical testing (D)","Carbon Fibers; Chemical Properties; Composites; Fracture; Ply Adhesion; Toughness; Carbon fibers; Carbon nanotubes; Ductile fracture; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fracture testing; Hybrid composites; Nanocrystals; Carbon fiber (A); Delamination (B); Delamination resistance; Fiber-matrix bonds; Fiber-matrix interphase; Fiber/matrix bond (B); Fibre-reinforced composite; Interfacial strength; Mechanical testing (D); Mode II; Fracture toughness","A.

However, the non-degradable resin matrix and non-destructive recycling of carbon fibers present a challenge for their sustainability. To address this issue, we have developed a new type of CFRCs that are readily recyclable and high-performing, using an auto-catalyzed tung oil-derived vitrimer and acid curing agents (TTMA) in combination with bisphenol A epoxy resin (DGEBA) or 4,4′-methylene bis (N,N-di glycidylaniline) (TGDOM). The DGEBA/TGDOM-TTMA networks contain abundant ester bonds, hydroxyl groups, and tertiary amine, which can undergo dynamic transesterification reactions (DTER) at high temperatures, leading to topological rearrangement of cross-linked networks. This results in an epoxy resin matrix with excellent mechanical properties, thermostability, and easy reprocessing, self-healing, and degradation at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the TGDOM-TTMA exhibits good stress relaxation properties due to the high concentrations of hydroxyl and tertiary amine. Additionally, we have found that carbon fibers can be completely recycled from CFRCs using ethanolamine via amidation reaction, with the recycled carbon fibers maintaining nearly 100% of the mechanical properties of the virgin samples. This study offers a sustainable and convenient strategy for designing readily recyclable and high-performance CFRCs, with important implications for the future of composite materials. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","auto-catalyzed vitrimers; CFRCs; degradable; recyclable; tung oil","Amines; Catalysis; Crosslinking; Epoxy resins; Fiber reinforced plastics; Recycling; Stress relaxation; Thermosets; Auto-catalyzed vitrimer; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Degradable; Engineering equipments; High durability; High-strength; Recyclables; Sports equipment; Tertiary amine; Tung oil; Carbon fibers","J.

This study proposes an effective methodology for a Multi-scale and Multi-material Composite Anisotropic Penalization (MMCAP) model to investigate multi-scale and multi-material design optimization of a fiber-reinforced variable stiffness (VS) composite structure to minimize structural compliance. In the concurrent MMCAP model, the macroscopic multi-material structural topology and microscopic discrete fiber laying angle selection are introduced as independent design variables and optimized simultaneously. The modified Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) and the Discrete Material Optimization (DMO) approaches are utilized at the macro- and micro-scales, respectively, to realize a clear macroscopic multi-material structural topology and microscopic specific discrete fiber laying angle selection. Multi-material fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) materials, such as carbon fiber–reinforced plastic (CFRP) and glass fiber–reinforced plastic (GFRP), are considered two types of solid materials in terms of structural volume cost. Sensitivity analysis of the structural compliance concerning the variables of the two geometrical scales is performed using the analytical sensitivity analysis method. The DMO approach is utilized to couple two geometrical scales: macroscopic topology and microscopic material selection. The capabilities of the proposed MMCAP are demonstrated by concurrent multi-material and multi-scale design optimization of composite panels. The influence of the number of discrete fiber laying angles on the structural compliance and optimized topology configuration is also been discussed. Numerical studies showed that the proposed MMCAP scheme can effectively realize multi-material and multi-scale design optimization of fiber-reinforced composite structure with achieving a clear macroscopic multi-material structural topology and microscopic fiber laying angle. The proposed MMCAP scheme provides a new implementation strategy for lightweight, multi-material, and multi-scale design optimization of composite materials, considering the design and manufacturing collaboration through additive manufacturing technology. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Concurrent multi-scale design optimization; Multi-material topology optimization; Multi-scale design optimization; Variable stiffness of laminated composite","3D printing; Additives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Laminated composites; Sensitivity analysis; Stiffness; Structural analysis; Structure (composition); Topology; Concurrent multi-scale design optimization; Design optimization; Multi materials; Multi-material topology optimization; Multi-scale design; Multi-scale design optimization; Topology optimisation; Variable stiffness; Variable stiffness of laminated composite; Shape optimization","J.

Naturally available animal bones and plant stems are light in weight due to their natural cellular structures. This may inspire various researchers for integrating the various lattice structures such as beam, planar, triply periodic minimal surfaces, and voronoi structures on the various structural materials. The development of lattice structures using 3D printing technology has opened up major attention towards fabricating lightweight components without any complications. In this study, the detailed crashworthiness responses such as compressive strength was optimized in terms of varying the topology-related factors on the carbon fiber reinforced polyethylene terephthalate glycol (CF/PETG) composite. The experimentation was conducted concerning variable topology factors such as shell thickness, unit cell type, wall thickness (WT), unit cell orientation (UCO), skewing angle, and unit cell size. The model was examined and optimized by means of the Taguchi optimization technique. The crashworthiness response was analyzed using the compression test and moreover, this experimental response is used for the optimization processes. From the observation, the topology factors which contributed more for the higher compressive strength will be UCO of 65.47% and WT of 15.20%. Results of the regression study show that the R square value with concern to the compressive strength will be 92.74%. The optimized design parametric condition for CF/PETG composite established a higher compressive strength of 41.179 MPa, From the overall results, it is clear that the variation in the topology factors has developed a huge and favorable impact on the mechanical characteristics of the lattice-structured CF/PETG polymer composite. Highlights: Hexagonal Lattice structure incorporation on the carbon fiber reinforced PETG composite. Design optimization on the compressive properties.

Early failure of the core-facesheet and central nodes, as well as fiber misalignment, can hinder the full potential of an LTCSC. This study aimed at improving the compressive stiffness and strength of LTCSC panels through minimizing the fiber misalignment and fabrication issues, while strengthening the central and core-facesheet nodes. The lost-molding technique was used to fabricate LTCSC panels, which were then subjected to quasi-static flatwise compression testing. Relative positioning of neighboring composite struts, modification of the carbon fiber path, and strengthening of the core-facesheet node significantly improved the compressive performance of the panels. Based on the findings, compressive strength and stiffness of LTCSC panels can be improved about 100% and 300%, respectively, with minimal increase in weight. Fabricated LTCSC panels were found to demonstrate competitive specific compressive properties in comparison with conventional core materials. © The Author(s) 2023.","core-facesheet node; fiber misalignment; lattice truss core; lost-molding technique; topology configuration; ultralightweight","Alignment; Carbon fibers; Compression testing; Coremaking; Fabrication; Molding; Sandwich structures; Stiffness; Struts; Trusses; Core-facesheet node; Face sheets; Fibre misalignment; Lattice truss cores; Lose-molding technique; Molding techniques; Sandwich composite panels; Strength and stiffness; Topology configurations; Ultra lightweights; Compressive strength","R.J.

The key to resolve them is designing epoxy resins from non-petroleum-based raw materials, recycling high-value carbon fibers, and improving interfacial interaction. We have increased availably interfacial interaction and performance by changing the topological structure of epoxy resins from linear to hyperbranched shape.

Fused deposition modeling (FDM) of polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG)/Carbon fiber (CF) material was utilized to develop and build the structure's topology. The mechanical characteristics of PETG/CF materials were evaluated through modeling, which was quantitatively linked to the experimental results. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to evaluate the fracture surface material before and after failure testing. The actual tests and numerical studies used five different fabrication structures which were correlated with deformation, force, and failure mode. ANSYS software was used with experimental results and finite element analysis (FEA) under both dynamic and quasi-static conditions. Five 3D printed materials of PETG reinforced with short CFs of approximately 7.6 μm in a weight fraction of 20% were investigated. The overall goal was to create a cost-effective and straightforward material production technology that can retain high mechanical strength while also providing suitable flexibility. The tensile test results of the 3D-printed PETG/CF solid structural design revealed a 23% improvement in yield strength over the other conventional structures.

However, CFRP casing designs must accommodate electrical interactions with encased equipment. Approaches to fault management and electrical protection must ensure that both electrical power system (EPS) and CFRP casing are protected against electrical faults. Knowledge of the electrical and thermal response of the CFRP casing underpins fault resilient casing design. The proposed CFRP casing is a wound filament (WF) CFRP tube for an IMD. This article presents the first experimentally validated methodology to capture macroscale electrical and thermal response of a WF CFRP tube to low frequency current. This knowledge is subsequently combined with wider EPS design considerations, including electrical grounding and bonding, to control fault response, enabling implementation of appropriate protection solutions. The results indicate that tuning casing resistance is not a viable, immediate option to control fault response, and that wider electrical system design options (grounding topologies) must be considered.

Historically they have been constrained to specific material types and geometry due to limitations in manufacturing methods. However, employing additive manufacturing (AM), specifically direct ink writing (DIW), can provide an alternative method for making SS composites with complex and controllable micro and mesostructures with multifunctionality targeted at desired mechanical, thermal, and electrical properties. DIW, an extrusion-based AM technique, uses a viscous and thixotropic ink with desired components that, once printed, is cured to obtain the final complex net shape parts. In this paper, a novel hybrid AM technique is employed to manufacture SS composite materials containing bisphenol A-based epoxy core and carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) face sheets that are fabricated via DIW and vacuum infusion process (VIP), respectfully. We demonstrate that the fabrication of these SS composites can be tailored from a thermosetting material, from which additives and/or various lattice structures can be manufactured to achieve enhanced and desirable mechanical integrity with functional properties. Surface topology and mechanical testing techniques are used to characterize the fabricated hybrid SS composites to study and assess mechanical stability. A rheo-kinetic cure model was developed for the core material to allow for additive manufacturing process requirements while ensuring complete cross-linking for the thermoset-based core material. Because of the ability to obtain relatively small core-thickness and controlled architecture, this method now allows for fabricating layered micro-sandwich structures for realizing further light-weighting in relevant applications. © The Author(s) 2022.","additive manufacturing; direct ink writing; epoxy resin; hybrid manufacturing; sandwich structures","3D printers; Additives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Coremaking; Curing; Fabrication; Functional materials; Hybrid materials; Mechanical stability; Mechanical testing; Sandwich structures; Vacuum applications; Core material; Direct ink writing; Epoxy-based; Flexural stiffness; High-strength; Hybrid manufacturing; Manufacturing techniques; Material's type; Specific materials; Strength to weight ratio; Epoxy resins","Z.L.

This corrosion-resistant reinforcement material leads to a reduction in the concrete cover required for medial shielding. This enables lean construction and the conservation of concrete and energy-intensive cement manufacturing. Bar-type reinforcement is essential for heavily loaded structures. The newly developed helix pultrusion is the first process capable of producing carbon fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) reinforcement bars with a topological surface in a single pultrusion process step, with fiber orientation tailored to the specific loads. The manufacturing feasibility and load-bearing capacity were thoroughly tested and compared with other design and process variants. Approaches to increase stiffness and strength while maintaining good concrete anchorage have been presented and fabricated. Tensile testing of the helical rebar variants with a 7.2 mm lead-bearing cross-section was conducted using adapted wedge grips with a 300 mm restraint length. The new helix geometry variants achieved, on average, 40% higher strengths and almost reached the values of the base material. Concrete pull-out tests were carried out to evaluate the bond properties. The helix contour design caused the bar to twist out of the concrete test specimen. Utilizing the Rilem beam test setup, the helical contour bars could also be tested. Compared with the original helix variant, the pull-out forces could be increased from 8.5 kN to up to 22.4 kN, i.e., by a factor of 2.5. It was thus possible to derive a preferred solution that is optimally suited for use in carbon concrete. © 2023 by the authors.","carbon–concrete composites; helix rebar; pull-out test; pultrusion; tensile test","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Construction industry; Corrosion resistance; Pultrusion; Reinforced concrete; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Carbon–concrete composite; Concrete composites; Corrosion-resistant; Helix rebar; Polymer rebars; Pull-out test; Reinforced concrete structures; Reinforcement materials; Tensile test; Tensile testing","H.F.M.

In the present study, molybdenum-doped ZnAl2O4 loaded on carbon fiber (Mo–ZnAl2O4/CF) was fabricated via a simple hydrothermal synthetic approach. Due to its unique hierarchical nanostructures and enhanced electrical, structural topologies, Mo-doped ZnAl2O4 demonstrates exceptional supercapacitor performance and electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction activity. The Mo-doped ZnAl2O4 electrode material exhibited 1477.63 F g−1 specific capacitance, 46.57 Wh Kg−1 specific energy and specific power of 476.4 W kg−1 at 1 A g−1. After 5000 cycles, the pseudo supercapacitor retains 97.46% of its capacitance and displays stable behavior over 50 h. During the OER reaction, the Mo–ZnAl2O4/CF as an electrocatalyst rapidly self-reconstructs, resulting in many oxygen vacancies, and causes a lower 38 mV dec−1 Tafel slope and overpotential potential of 255 mV to achieved 10 mA cm−2 current flow and responsible for the excellent stability of the electrocatalyst. These findings suggest that multifunctional materials based electrode for electrical energy conversion and storage become more efficient and stable by using Mo for doping to generate porous hierarchical structures and local amorphous phases. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l.","Carbon fiber; Electrocatalyst supercapacitors; Hydrothermal; Mo doped ZnAl<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub>; Oxygen evolution reaction","Aluminum compounds; Capacitance; Carbon fibers; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Energy conversion; Molybdenum; Nanorods; Oxygen vacancies; Slope stability; Structural design; Zinc compounds; Bi-functional; Design technique; Doping techniques; Electrocatalyst supercapacitor; Electrochemical energy storage; Hydrothermal; Mo doped znal2O4; Nano-rod arrays; Splitting strategies; Water splitting; Supercapacitor","M.N.

The typical body-in-white (BiW) accounts for up to 40% of the total vehicle mass, making it the focus of light-weighting efforts through a) conceptual redesign b) design optimization using state-of-the-art computer-aided engineering (CAE) tools, and c) use of advanced high strength steels (AHSS), aluminum, magnesium, and/or fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) composites. However, most of these light-weighting efforts have been focused on luxury/sports vehicles, with a relatively high price range and an average production of 100, 000 units/year or less. With increasing sports utility vehicle (SUV) sales in North America, focus has shifted to developing lightweight designs for this segment. Thus, the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Vehicle Technologies Office has initiated a multi-year research and development program to enable cost-effective light-weighting of a mid-size SUV. The proposed designs shall enable weight reduction of a minimum of 160 lb. (~72.7 kg), with a maximum allowable cost increase of $5 for every pound of weight reduced. The proposed designs shall enable vehicle production rates of 200, 000 units/year and will be aimed at retaining the joining/assembly line employed by the OEM. A systems approach has been utilized to develop a multi-material, light-weight redesign of the SUV BiW that meets or exceeds the baseline structural performance. This study delves into the development of design targets for the proposed redesign at the system, sub-assembly, and component levels. Furthermore, results from topology optimization studies on a design volume were assessed to understand the load paths under various loading conditions. Several multi-material concept designs were proposed based on the insights provided by the topology optimization study. Novel multi-material joining methodologies have been incorporated to enable maximum retention of the OEM's joining and assembly process without significantly increasing cost. This paper presents the systems approach, and results from design studies undertaken to meet the program challenges. © 2022. Used by CAMX - The Composites and Advanced Materials Expo.

Carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP), as one material with high ratio of modulus to density, is widely employed to realize the lightweight design. To maximize the stiffness and strength of CFRP with prescribed mass, fiber orientation and topology optimization are accomplished and optimum design result is acquired in this paper. First, the optimization algorithm of fiber orientation is put forward to find the optimal fiber direction and verified by theoretical analysis and simulations, illustrating that [90°/+ 45°/− 45°/0°] fiber orientation and symmetrical laminas are indispensable. Furthermore, the topology optimization algorithm including the density interpolation method and sensitivity analysis method is brought about to find the optimal material distribution. The algorithm is validated to be convergent and can provide a conceptual model which offers a reference for the critical design. Finally, acquired in the mechanical test is the performance of the optical remote sensor whose first three characteristic frequencies are respectively 66.95 Hz, 70.37 Hz, and 98.84 Hz. The mechanical amplification factor is 5.29, which meet the performance requirement of the stiffness and strength for the optical remote sensor. © 2022 Elsevier GmbH","CFRP; Constitutive matrix; Fiber orientation optimization; Space-borne optical remote sensor; Topology optimization","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Optical remote sensing; Sensitivity analysis; Shape optimization; Structural optimization; Topology; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Constitutive matrices; Fiber orientation optimization; Fibre orientation; Lightweight design; Optical remote sensors; Optimisations; Space-borne; Space-borne optical remote sensor; Topology optimisation; Stiffness","B.

This study presents a method to achieve topological structures with effective zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR) integrating topological structures with negative Poisson's ratio (NPR) and positive Poisson's ratio (PPR). The topologically designed structures were fabricated using 3D printing with short carbon fibre reinforced polyamide (SCF/PA). Finite element analysis was developed to simulate the compression behaviours of the structures that were experimentally characterised with the aid of digital image correlation. The results demonstrated the unique behaviours of topologically designed structures with the desired NPR, PPR and ZPR. Negative strain is predominant in NPR specimens while positive strain is significant in PPR specimens. In contrast, ZPR specimens present mitigated negative and positive strain with insignificant lateral deformation. The features and mechanisms discussed in this study can provide valuable data for metamaterials analysis and novel structural design. © 2022","Additive manufacturing; Finite element analysis; Positive/negative/zero Poisson's ratio; Short carbon fibre reinforced polymers; Topology optimisation","3D printers; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Metamaterials; Poisson ratio; Reinforcement; Structural design; Topology; 3-D printing; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Finite element analyse; Negative Poisson ratio; Positive/negative; Positive/negative/zero poisson ratio; Short carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Short carbon fibers; Topology optimisation; Zero Poisson's ratios; Finite element method","L.

Additive manufacturing with concrete, also called 3D concrete printing (3DCP) has emerged from these requirements. It enables formwork-free, robot-supported construction and saves resources through slim design. Integration of reinforcement into 3D concrete printing remains however a major challenge. The article at hand presents the recent work at the TU Dresden focusing on the integration of mineral-bonded and polymer-bonded carbon fiber heavy tows in additive manufacturing with concrete. The research work is part of the CRC/TRR 280 sub-project D01. In this technology, the continuous fiber bundles are impregnated with ultra-fine mineral suspension prior to merging them with concrete. The integration of carbon fibers into the 3D printing process has been investigated using two different approaches. The first one makes use of a gantry printer, which enables printing relatively large cross-sections with multiple integrated carbon yarns. The other one uses a six-axis industrial robot arm as a manipulator for printing fine high-resolution structures with a high degree of reinforcement. This approach makes it possible to produce prefabricated 3D topologies with a highly branched inner structure. Such topological optimization stands for highly efficient use of resources, but it also poses special requirements with respect to concrete composition, such as set on demand, so that buildability can be ensured after fresh material is pumped and extruded. © Fédération Internationale du Béton – International Federation for Structural Concrete.","3D concrete printing; additive manufacturing; carbon fibers; CRC/TRR 280; reinforcement","Carbon fibers; Concretes; Construction industry; Integration; Machine design; Manipulators; Printing presses; Reinforcement; Topology; 3d concrete printing; Automated construction; Concrete printings; Construction sectors; Continuous fiber bundles; CRC/TRR 280; Dresdens; Formwork; Polymer bonded; Ultra-fines; 3D printers","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85143884237"

The proposed methodology is applied to a structure as a case study to verify that the methodology is effective. One design concept is created by subjecting the structure to a kinematic ply draping simulation to inform the partitioning of the structure, improve drapability and performance, and reduce structural defects. A second design concept is created that assumes that plies are draped over the entire structural geometry, forming an integral design. The two design concepts’ topologies are subsequently optimized to specify ideal material and ply geometries to minimize mass and reduce costs. The results indicate that the partitioned structure has a 19% lower mass and 15% lower material costs than the integral design. The two designs produced with the new methodology are also compared against two control designs created to emulate previously published methodologies that have not incorporated ply draping simulations. This demonstrates that neglecting the effects of ply draping produces topology optimization solutions that under-predict the mass of a structure by 26% and costs by 38%. © 2022 by the authors.

The traditional viscose process requires the use of environmentally harmful carbon disulfide solvent to produce fibers. Lyocell fibers, produced using a more sustainable recent process, exhibit differences in properties from viscose. These differences arise from their semicrystalline microstructure, formed during fiber spinning. It is widely believed that regenerated cellulose fibers predominantly form fringed fibrillar crystals. We optimize acid etching, followed by SEM as an experimental tool to visualize this fibrillar structure. Acid etching provides sufficient topological contrast to directly visualize ∼O(10 nm) fibrils using field-emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM). We combine SEM with small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) to reveal other microstructural details. We observe a Bragg peak, indicating the coexistence of stacked lamellar structure with crystalline fibrils for viscose fibers, but not for lyocell. Viscose and lyocell fibers are characterized by partially oriented semicrystalline microstructure. We present a methodology to calculate the Lorentz correction for such microstructure and employ this to analyze the lamellar scattering from viscose fibers using a 1D correlation function approach. We characterize the lamellar microstructure after swelling viscose fibers with water and observe expansion of the Bragg spacing due to water absorption in the amorphous regions. Our data suggest that the water-induced plasticization of amorphous regions is inhomogeneous. Lamellar stacks that are more misoriented from the fiber direction exhibit lower swelling than those along the fiber direction. The experimental methods described in this work reveal interesting details of semicrystalline microstructure in regenerated cellulose fibers, with important implications for the mechanical response of dry and wet fibers. The methods developed here might find use in investigations of other polymer fibers as well.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","acid etching; crystalline lamellae; fibers; fibrils; Lorentz correction; regenerated cellulose; SAXS","Acids; Cellulose Fibers; Fibrils; Microstructure; Processes; Regenerated Cellulose; Viscose; Water Absorption; Cellulose; Etching; Field emission microscopes; Lamellar structures; Natural fibers; Scanning electron microscopy; Sulfur compounds; Swelling; Textile fibers; Water absorption; X ray scattering; Correlation function; Experimental methods; Fibrillar structures; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Lamellar microstructure; Mechanical response; Regenerated cellulose; Stacked-lamellar structures; Spinning (fibers)","G.

However, limited by the solid powder form, most COFs display low active site utilization and weak binding force with the current collector. In this pioneering research, we integrate redox-active COFs onto carbon fiber surfaces (AC-COFs) via strong covalent bridging. The 2,6-diaminoanthraquinone (DAAQ) pillars embedded on the carbon fiber surface are the key to precisely controlling the growth direction of COFs. The obtained tentacle-like array vertically supported on the surface of the carbon fiber can effectively induce charge transfer and prevent COFs from aggregating/collapsing. The strong covalent coupling and increase of accessible active sites contributed to the high specific capacitance of AC-COFs electrode (1034 mF cm−2). In addition, the COF-based flexible electrode retains an initial capacitance of 98% after 20000 charge− discharge cycles. The flexible all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor is assembled by PVA/H2SO4 gel electrolyte with an areal capacitance of 715 mF cm−2. Besides, a red LED can be easily powered by three-bending AC-COFs//AC-COFs devices. The innovative synthesis strategy opens up new opportunities to develop high-performance flexible energy storage devices based on COFs. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor; covalent organic frameworks; energy storage; flexible; stability","Capacitance; Charge transfer; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Energy storage; Redox reactions; Solid electrolytes; Supercapacitor; Active site; All-solid state; All-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor; Covalent organic frameworks; Crystal polymers; Fibre surfaces; Flexible; High porosity; Porous crystals; Symmetrics; Carbon fibers","N.

First, various articles were consulted to determine the fundamental structure of the turntable, and the azimuthal structure was selected. By researching the properties of different materials, M55J carbon fiber-which uses TC4 inserts for connection-was chosen as the main material for the turntable. The three main parts of the turntable are designed based on topological results and engineering experience; thus, a turntable frame with a size of 966 mm× 400 mm× 730 mm and mass of 27.3 kg is designed. Next, simulation analysis is carried out, from which the natural frequency of the entire turntable is established as 58 Hz. This implies that the strength and stiffness of the turntable fulfill the optimization criteria. Finally, resistance and thermal vacuum tests are conducted on the prototype. Test results showed that the natural frequency of the turntable was 53 Hz and the variation of the turntable's natural frequency was within 2% (sinusoidal vibration) and 4% (random vibration). Furthermore, we observed that the turntable functioned normally in a vacuum. Accordingly, the proposed design is tenable. © 2021, Science Press.

A thorough thermal-chemical-structural coupling is conducted for carbon fiber using the developed new modeling technique. The evolving topology of the residue carbon fiber is captured by the simulation without actual moving grid manipulation. Current results show that for single carbon fiber, surface oxidation can be harmful since pitting can occur at multiple locations on the surface and pitting can penetrate the entire fiber. The variability of surface roughness, or sites, is also investigated by using a Gaussian function. It is found that when the surface is coarser, it becomes easier for carbon to be oxidized. The full coupling study will also be conducted to show that as oxidation continues within the materials, it becomes more vulnerable for the carbon fibers to withstand their loading. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

A composite frame with a variable cross-section was designed, optimized, and fabricated using thermoforming technology. Both numerical simulations and experiments supported structural verification according to the damage tolerance philosophy; i.e., impact damage is presented. The Tsai-Wu and maximal stress criteria were used for damage analysis of the composite parts. Topological optimization of the metal hinges from the point of view of weight reduction was used. All expected parameters and proposed requirements of the mechanical properties were proved and completed. The door panel showed an expected numerically evaluated residual strength (ultimate structure load) as well as meeting airworthiness requirements. No impact damage propagation in the composite parts was observed during mechanical tests, even though visible impact damage was introduced into the structure. No significant difference between the numerical simulations and the experimentally measured total deformation was observed. Repeated deformation measurements during fatigue showed a nonlinear structure behavior. This can be attributed to the relaxation of thermoplastics. © 2021 by the authors.

However, due to the poor electrical conductivity of CFRP, the CFRP structure and electrical power system (EPS) must be kept physically separate via bulky, heavy cable harnesses and raceways. The closer integration of EPS with CFRP structure offers an opportunity to optimize the weight and volume of the combined electrical power and structural systems, reducing the need for harnesses and raceways. To enable this, there is a need to understand the implications that this will have for electrical power systems design, including approaches to protection. This paper identifies candidate protection solutions for resilient, integrated electrical-composite aircraft structures, by consideration of the interdependent trades between MEA EPS architecture design, CFRP, grounding topology, and electrical fault response. The influence of these interdependent elements on protection requirements is explored, and as a result, design rules for the protection of such resilient, integrated systems are formulated and presented, enabling a focus on the fault response of the system and development of appropriate protection solutions. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings.

To address this issue, a tannic acid (TA)/polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) hybrid microstructure, similar to the topological structure, is designed on the fiber surface by one-pot synthesis under mild conditions. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and atomic force microscopy (AFM) show that the functionality and surface roughness of the fiber are significantly broadened. Correspondingly, the tensile strength (TS) of CF-TA/POSS100 and interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) of CF-TA/POSS100-based composites increased by 18 and 34%, respectively. Following that, a failure mechanism study is conducted to demonstrate the interphase structure containing TA/POSS, which is quite critical in optimizing the mechanical performance of the multiscale composites. Moreover, the strategy for the use of TA for constructing a robust coating to replace the traditional modification without affecting the fiber intrinsic strength is an improved design and provides a new idea for the development of high-performance composites.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.","","Failure (mechanical); Flavonoids; Microstructure; Oligomers; Shear strength; Surface roughness; Tannins; Tensile strength; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbon fibre composites; Efficient strategy; Fibre surfaces; High performance composites; Interface modification; Polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxanes; Surface preparation; Surface-modification; Tannic acid; Topological structure; Carbon fibers","R.

Three different commercial CFs were investigated after treatment with either thermoplastic, epoxy, or vinyl-ester sizing agents and then compared to unsized CFs. During impregnating, diverse yarn-spreading behavioral modes and degrees of wetness were observed, indicating different degrees of impregnation, both in quality and quantity. All sizing agents decreased the hydrophobic nature of unsized CFs significantly. Supported by microscopic investigation, water contact angle measurement, and thermal gravimetric and mercury intrusion porosity, the epoxy sizing showed the best fiber-matrix distribution over the cross-section and a dense microstructure. Moreover, in single-fiber pullout tests each sizing brought about a significant increase in maximum pullout force, indicating enhanced bond between fiber and matrix. This is attributed to more intense interaction in the interfacial region, fully corroborating the topological characteristics obtained in microscopic analysis. With higher interfacial bond strength, the thermoplastic sizing enabled the highest tensile properties of MCF despite slightly less impregnation quality in comparison with epoxy-sized samples. © 2021","Carbon-fiber; Fiber sizing; Geopolymer; Mineral impregnation; Reinforcement","Carbon fibers; Contact angle; Geopolymers; Impregnation; Inorganic polymers; Microstructure; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Carbon fiber reinforcement; Epoxy; Fiber sizing; Geopolymer; Impregnated carbons; Microstructure morphologies; Mineral impregnation; Morphology and mechanical properties; Property; Sizing agents; Minerals","M.

The bending properties of sandwich sheets with 3D printed carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) lattice cores originating from basic topologies of spherical shell, tetrahedral truss and tetrahedral plate were systematically investigated. The effects of core topologies, core relative densities, core heights, face sheet thicknesses on structural properties were clarified. The common failure modes during bending of sandwich sheets, such as face buckling and shear failure of core, were deeply investigated by theoretical models and experimental tests. At a prescribed radius of 60 mm, the sandwich sheets with the bilayered dome, octet truss and plate lattice cores of relative density of 50 %, height of 6 mm and face sheet thickness of 0.5 mm are bendable.

Controlling fiber alignment in these composite systems can be used to design unique materials with direction-dependent properties, especially when coupled to topology optimization for light weighting and high strength. This study focuses on controlling fiber alignment in short carbon fiber composites with two printing parameters common in DW systems: nozzle diameter and velocity ratio. To do so, a novel rapid fiber alignment analysis (RFAA) was developed to quickly collect large amounts of fiber alignment data. Compared to the conventional fiber alignment quantification technique, X-Ray CT, RFAA is a rapid, accurate, and low-cost alternative. It was determined that fiber alignment can be enhanced by printing with smaller nozzle diameters and higher velocity ratios. Longitudinal bending stiffness and bending strength improved as the fiber alignment increased. Composites printed with low fiber alignment exhibited isotropic mechanical properties. However, aligning the fibers in the composite resulted in direction-dependent properties with significantly enhanced modulus and strength in the alignment direction. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Composites; Direct Ink Writing; short fiber","Bending strength; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Costs; Nozzles; Reinforcement; Stiffness; Velocity; Alignment analysis; Direct ink writing; Direct write; Fibre alignments; Low-costs; Nozzle diameter; Property; Short Fiber; Short-fiber-reinforced composites; Velocity ratio; 3D printers","E.

The discrete material and thickness optimization (DMTO) method is adopted to parameterize the design variables of thickness and orientation of CFRP composites, which is driven by the Method of Moving Asymptote (MMA) algorithm. A large number of local constraints associated with the failure criteria are aggregated in terms of a p-norm function. Analytical sensitivities are derived with respect to the design variables. In this study, a battery hanging structure in electrical vehicle (EV) is exemplified; and a DMTO based design is prototyped and validated through the in-house experimental tests first. To prevent different failure modes, the Hashin, Hoffman and Tsai-Wu failure criteria are then imposed as the design constraints together with manufacturing requirements in the optimization. A comparative study is performed for the design with and without such failure criteria. The results demonstrate that the maximum failure index of the optimized structure with the Tsai-Wu failure criterion decreases the most by 40%; and follows by the Hashin and Hoffman criteria by 24% and 33%, respectively. Finally, the CFRP structure is also optimized to design a so-called double-double laminates for demonstrating the generality of the proposed method.

For composites with negative Poisson's ratio, a small addition of CCFs (VCCF = 0.23%) can increase the effective elastic modulus by 59% and the negative Poisson's ratio from −0.24 to −0.34 for the PA auxetic specimens.

Previously, we showed that metal nanoparticle-modified carbon significantly improves adenine-based purine detection; however, how the size and shape of the particles impact electrochemical detection was not investigated. Electrochemical investigations of how the surface topology and morphology impacts detection is necessary for designing ultrasensitive electrodes and for expanding fundamental knowledge of electrode-analyte interactions. To change the density and shape of the PtNP s on the surface, we varied the concentration of K2PtCl6 and electrodeposition time. We show that increasing the concentration of K2PtCl6 increases the density of PtNP's while increasing the electrodeposition time impacts both the density and size. These changes manipulate the adsorption behavior which impacts sensitivity. Based on these results, an optimal electrodeposition procedure was determined to be 1.0 mg ml-1 of K2PtCl6 deposited for 45 s and this results in an average increase in adenosine detection by 3.5 ± 0.3-fold. Interestingly, increasing the size and density of PtNPs negatively impacts dopamine detection. Overall, this work provides fundamental insights into the differences between adenosine and dopamine interaction at electrode surfaces.  © 2022 The Electrochemical Society (""ECS"").

While the tensile properties of vitrimer laminates have been extensively studied, interlaminar properties have yet to be demonstrated. Experiments on mode I interlaminar fracture toughness and flexural characteristics of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) composites based on epoxy-dicarboxylic acid vitrimer with various epoxy:acid ratios are presented in this paper. By hand lay-up and hot press, two vitrimer laminates with epoxy:acid ratio of 1:0.5 (off-stoichiometric, C50/CF) and 1:1 (stoichiometric, C100/CF) were successfully fabricated. From the flexural test, both C50/CF and C100/CF reveal marvellous stiffness of ∼60 GPa. Additionally, C50/CF also shows excellent flexural strength of 821 MPa which is in a similar range to conventional anhydride epoxy CFRP composites. In terms of interlaminar fracture properties under mode I loading, vitrimer CFRP composites outperform standard epoxy laminates on mode I fracture energy at initiation and propagation zones. At the initiation stage, fracture energies of C50/CF and C100/CF are two times higher than those of epoxy/CF. Furthermore, the average fracture energies during crack propagation of C50/CF and C100/CF were increased by ∼42% and ∼63%, respectively, when compared to epoxy/CF. The fracture surfaces of vitrimer laminates revealed matrix residue on the fibres, demonstrating that vitrimer and carbon fibres had good interfacial adhesion. These findings revealed a huge potential for further development of vitrimer CFRP composites for advanced applications. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","CFRP; Interlaminar fracture toughness; Vitrimer","","M.

Existing approaches to combat fatigue are usually based on nano-scale additives that slow the growth of cracks in the polymer. While this prolongs fatigue-life, it cannot avert eventual failure since crack growth is being slowed and not reversed. Other approaches have explored self-healing polymers that release a curing agent to repair local damage. However, this approach also fails to tackle fatigue, since once the curing agent is released, it gets consumed and cannot be re-used. To addresses the irreversibility of fatigue, we report here a vitrimeric system, for which reversal of fatigue damage can be achieved repeatedly, by heating the material to above its topology freezing transition temperature. This enables intermittent healing of fatigue-induced damage, as it accumulates in the vitrimer matrix. Using this approach, we show that fatigue failure in vitrimers and in carbon-fiber reinforced vitrimers (vCFRP) can be postponed indefinitely. Such vCFRPs could open the door to future materials, in which natural aging and fatigue processes can be periodically reversed, so as to guarantee safe and reliable long-term operation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon-fiber composites; Fatigue; Healing; Vitrimers","Additives; Cracks; Curing; Fatigue damage; Fibers; Nanotechnology; Carbon fiber reinforced; Carbon fibre composites; Catastrophic failures; Curing agents; Fiber-reinforced polymeric composites; Healing; Local damage; Nano scale; Self-healing polymers; Vitrimer; Reinforcement","C.R.

Metallized CFRPs and multimaterials based on metals are highly attractive for such applications. In this study, we deposited Sn on an epoxy-based CFRP via cold spraying and investigated the effects of gas temperature on Sn deposition behavior. A continuous Sn coating was successfully obtained on the CFRP at gas temperatures ranging from 473 to 523 K. By contrast, severe erosion of the CFRP substrate occurred at 623 K, making the cold spray coating of Sn difficult. The relationships between the processing temperature, surface topology, and erosion state are examined from the perspective of the CFRP surface temperature. The results indicate that a higher gas temperature leads to a greater surface temperature, resulting in an uneven surface topology with more severe erosion accompanied by a gradual decrease in coating thickness. © 2021, ASM International.","carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP); cold spray; erosion; metallization; multi-materials; surface temperature","Aerospace industry; Atmospheric temperature; Erosion; Metals; Plastic coatings; Processing; Surface properties; Thickness measurement; Topology; Carbon fiber reinforced plastic; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Cold spray; Cold spraying; Gas temperature; Metallisation; Multi materials; Severe erosion; Surface temperatures; Surface topology; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","K.

Two mechanisms contribute to the interlaminar bond strength development in the interface between the incoming tow and the substrate: (a) the development of intimate contact between the two surfaces and (b) the formation of a fusion bond across those contacting surfaces known as healing. So far, a number of different theoretical intimate contact models have been proposed in the literature to study intimate contact development for different manufacturing processes. However, very limited experimental methods are available to measure degree of intimate contact. To fill this gap, a new experimental approach based on topology of the tape surface is introduced to quantify the degree of intimate contact for the AFP process. The new approach is based on the Bearing Area Curve (BAC) of the surface profile of the tape. To implement the new procedure, an unidirectional strips of carbon fiber/PEEK were laid down on the polished steel tool with different placement rates, compaction forces, hot gas torch (HGT) temperatures, and tool temperatures. The degree of intimate contact is calculated based on the proposed experimental approach and compared with prediction models from the literature. Furthermore, the effect of AFP process parameters on the degree of intimate contact is studied using BAC method and the effective intimate contact model. The results showed that the development of intimate contact is significantly governed by the torch and tool temperature. © 2022 The Author(s)","Automated Fiber Placement (AFP); Bearing Area Curve (BAC); Intimate contact development; Thermoplastic composites","","F.

During early adoption of composites in the rail transportation industry, these materials have predominantly been applied to simple design geometries and lightly loaded structures, have been optimized only through modification of composite thickness and composite layer shape, and have only been constrained with respect to a single mechanical performance metric. This study investigates the use of finite element analysis software in the simulation of fiber-reinforced composite materials applied to, and optimized for, a complex and heavily loaded rail vehicle anchor bracket. The research assesses the applicability of optimization methodologies to a complex and heavily loaded structure and advances established practices by constraining the solution with respect to multiple design requirements: manufacturing, compliance, and failure criterion.

However, out of practicality, the majority of fiber interfacial simulations use multi-element, fixed-topology force-fields that are not harmonized with leading carbon-only potentials, resulting in the widespread adoption of graphite as a surrogate model of carbon fiber in interfacial simulations, neglecting complexity. To address this, a process for generating complex yet practical structural models of the carbon fiber surface is introduced. A carbon-only potential is used to generate topologically and topographically rich surfaces via annealing molecular dynamics simulations and manipulation of periodic boundary conditions. This produces fiber surfaces featuring edges, holes, convergent sheet boundaries, topological defects, amongst other structures. Key parameters of the process influence this complexity, ensuring structural tuneability of the resultant substrate. These structures are transposed into a multi-element molecular mechanics format. This approach provides practical structural models for immediate application in any interfacial simulation between carbon fiber and its complex environment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fiber; Molecular modelling; Nanoscale topography; Surface topology","Carbon fibers; Molecular dynamics; Molecular structure; Surface structure; Topology; Atomic scale; Atomistic modelling; Fibre surfaces; Molecular simulations; Multielements; Nanoscale topography; Structural modeling; Structure-properties relationships; Surface modeling; Surface topology; Topography","T.R.

As the main concern, full composite sandwich structures were manufactured with carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) facesheets and designed cores. Three-point bending tests have been performed to assess the mechanical performance of designed cellular sandwich structures. To evaluate the energy harvesting performance, the piezoelectric transducer was integrated at the interface between the upper facesheet and core, with both sinusoidal base excitation input and acceleration measured from real cruising aircraft and vehicle. It has been found that the sandwich with conventional honeycomb core has demonstrated the best mechanical performance, assessed under the bending tests. In terms of energy harvesting performance, sandwich with re-entrant honeycomb manifested approximately 20% higher RMS voltage output than sandwiches with conventional honeycomb and chiral structure core, evaluated both numerically and experimentally. The resistance sweep tests further suggested that the power output from sandwich with re-entrant honeycomb core was twice as large as that from sandwiches with conventional honeycomb and chiral structure cores, under optimal external resistance and sinusoidal base excitation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Piezoelectric energy harvesting; Polymer-matrix composites (PMCs); Smart materials; Vibration","Automotive industry; Bending tests; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Energy harvesting; Piezoelectricity; Polymer matrix composites; Sandwich structures; Topology; Vibrations (mechanical); Chiral structures; Composite sandwich structure; Face sheets; Honeycomb core; Mechanical performance; Performance; Piezoelectric energy harvesting; Polymer-matrix composite; Sinusoidal base excitation; Vibration; Honeycomb structures","Y.

To improve crash performance in these accidents, a crash box is attached between the vehicle bumper structure and the side rail. The determination of the crash box material and geometry is critical to absorb the impact energy to result in safer vehicles and minimised repair costs. As the automotive industry transitions to more sustainable platforms, it is seeking to use lightweight materials including in the crash structure. This study develops an innovative crash box with optimal impact energy-absorption capabilities for a fuel cell electric vehicle. The concept is based on topology optimisation considering the composite structure and crash energy dissipation.

PCFs were fabricated by electrospinning, carbonizing, and pyrolyzing poly(acrylonitrile)-b-poly(methyl methacrylate) (PAN-b-PMMA) block copolymer nanofiber frameworks. Commonly, porous nanofibers are used for energy storage applications, but we present an application of these materials for biosensing, which has not been previously studied. This modification impacted the topology and enhanced redox cycling at the surface. PCF modifications increased the oxidative current for dopamine (2.0 ± 0.1)-fold (n = 33) with significant increases in detection sensitivity. PCFs are known to have more edge plane sites which we speculate lead to the 2-fold increase in electroactive surface area. Capacitive current changes were negligible, providing evidence that improvements in detection are due to faradaic processes at the electrode. The ΔEpfor dopamine decreased significantly at modified CFMEs. Only a 2.2 ± 2.2% change in dopamine current was observed after repeated measurements and only 10.5 ± 2.8% after 4 h, demonstrating the stability of the modification over time. We show significant improvements in norepinephrine, ascorbic acid, adenosine, serotonin, and hydrogen peroxide detection. Lastly, we demonstrate that the modified electrodes can detect endogenous, unstimulated release of dopamine in living slices of rat striatum. Overall, we provide evidence that porous nanostructures significantly improve neurochemical detection with FSCV and echo the necessity for investigating the extent to which geometry impacts electrochemical detection. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

To reduce the number of training samples and improve the regression accuracy, an active learning strategy is implemented by successively supplying effective samples along with the suboptimal process. After proper training of neural networks, a quasi-global search strategy can be applied by implementing a large number of initial designs as starting points in the optimization. In this article, a mathematical example is first presented to show the superiority of the active learning strategy. Then a benchmark design example of a CFRP plate is scrutinized to compare the proposed ML-based with the conventional FEA-based discrete material optimization (DMO) method. Finally, topology optimization of fiber orientations is performed for design of a CFRP engine hood, in which the structural performance generated from the proposed ML-based approach achieves 12.62% improvement compared with that obtained from the conventional single-initial design method.

To develop bendable sandwich sheets, a new design strategy was proposed in this study, in which the density-based topology optimization was integrated with the multi-stage genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the material layout so that the sandwich topologies can withstand potential failures including core shear failure, core-face sheet delamination and face buckling at given bending conditions. The topology optimization problem was mathematically formulated based on theoretically deduced failure constraints on core shear failure, face buckling and core-face sheet delamination. The adaptive multi-stage GA was adopted to solve the topology optimization problem with massive design variables and generate optimized topologies with sufficient resolutions to be additively manufacturable. The optimal topologies at given volume fraction constraints were additively manufactured using carbon fibre reinforced nylon (Onyx) and bending tests were conducted to check the bendability. Results indicate that topologically optimized SUS304/Onyx/SUS304 sandwich sheets can be bent without failure, which demonstrates the validity of the proposed topology optimization strategy. The proposed method is potentially capable of designing bendable sandwich sheets with arbitrary material combinations and is expected to expand the application envelope of lightweight sandwich structures. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastics; Forming; Sandwich sheet; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Bending tests; Carbon fibers; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Topology; Carbon fiber reinforced; Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic; Core shear; Face sheets; Fiber reinforced thermoplastics; Multi-stages; Optimization problems; Sandwich sheets; Shear failure; Topology optimisation; Genetic algorithms","J.

Here, an ultra-stretchable and self-cleaning nonwoven textile-based bioelectrode combining prominent health monitoring performance with outstanding anti-fouling ability is rationally designed and successfully fabricated via the synergistic combination of carbon black nanoparticle/CNT (CB/CNT) stretchable conductive networks and superhydrophobic perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane modified TiO2 nanoparticles (PFOTES-TiO2 NPs). The adaptive CB/CNT conductive networks on elastic fibers can facilitate efficient charge transfer under ultra-high deformation (>10 times stretching), while the outermost PFOTES-TiO2 NPs layer with good interlayer adhesion provides the micro-topological structure and low surface energy. As a result, the conductive textile used as skin-attachable bioelectrode manifests remarkable performance for personal health monitoring, including an ultra-broad detection range of 1050.0% and an extremely high GF value up to 1134.7 as wearable strain sensor, and outstanding detection ability to electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyography (EMG) signals. Moreover, the bioelectrode also possesses terrific anti-fouling properties and resistance to various corrosive fluids and even severe mechanical damage, ensuring its long-term operation stability under harsh environments.

In particular, we record the quadrupole-split 7Li-NMR spectra and 7Li longitudinal relaxation over a wide temperature range, and determine lithium self-diffusion both parallel and perpendicular to the fiber axis. Recording the temperature dependence permits us to interpret the presence of motional averaging of spin couplings for mobile Li. The joint analysis shows that at low Li content, Li occupies sites that lack ordered coordination and delocalized electrons and are collected in disordered spatial domains. Upon increasing the Li content, ordered sites collected in ordered domains become populated. Both disordered and ordered domains have a high inherent heterogeneity with a typical spatial extension of a few nanometers. The disordered domains exhibit a continuous topology that permits unhindered diffusion within it. At high Li content we also observe the presence of very small (∼nm) particles of metallic lithium. The joint analysis of XRD in combination with diffusion anisotropy, and anisotropy from the 7Li-NMR spectrum (with samples oriented differently with regard to the applied magnetic field), shows that the mesoscopic structure is made by ordered domains arranged in a cylindrically rolled-up manner with the mesoscopic axis parallel to the fiber axis. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","","Diffusion; Lithium; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Superconducting materials; Temperature distribution; X ray diffraction; Disordered domains; Fiber axis; Hard carbon; Joint analysis; Li content; Li-NMR spectrum; Lithium insertion; Local order; Ordered domains; XRD; Anisotropy","I.

Although the origins of topology optimization dates back to late 1980s, even today, there is less insight in translating the optimized topology into engineering application [1]. This field is actively evolving around design of composite structures to obtain high-performing lightweight structures. The focus here is on the development of components consisting of a 3D printed metallic insert, which acts as a load introduction element into the surrounding carbon fiber reinforced plastic. Thanks to the novel technologies like TFP (tailored fiber placement) by which fiber bundles can be custom placed and stitched along the optimized path determined using FE simulations. The rough surface nature of additive manufactured parts supports the load carrying capacity at component level because of its superior interface bond strength. Challenges involved here are to simulate the component behavior without neglecting the physics, manufacturing restrictions and complexities. This paper is aimed at comparing the application of two composite topology optimization strategies/algorithms offered by ABAQUS Tosca®, namely condition-based and the most applied continuous and density based, Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) approach [6]. The stack up configurations were predefined as per the design rules [5] and the best fiber topology along the load path was determined by minimizing its compliance. In our study, we attempt to address the simulation challenges encountered in the context of the optimization of anisotropic 3D topology applied to composites. Using the voxel-based Finite Element (FE) approach, some of these numerical examples will be illustrated in this paper with the help of a simple toy model. ©2022 Nagaraj et al.","compliance; Condition-based; quasiisotropic layup; SIMP; Tailored fiber placement; Topology optimization; voxel-based FE","3D printing; ABAQUS; Anisotropy; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Product design; Shape optimization; Structural design; Compliance; Condition; Condition-based; Fibre placement; Quasi-isotropic; Quasiisotropic layup; Solid isotropic material with penalizations; Tailored fiber placement; Topology optimisation; Voxel-based finite element; Topology","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85149419993"

The replacement of the steel reinforcement in conventional elastomeric bearings for a carbon fiber reinforcement is a possible solution and has garnered increasing attention. To investigate the response of fiber-reinforced elastomeric bearings (FREBs) under seismic loads, it is fundamental to understand its mechanical behavior under combined vertical and horizontal loads. An experimental investigation of the components presents complexities due to the high loads and displacements tested. The use of a finite element analysis can save time and resources by avoiding partially expensive experimental campaigns and by extending the number of geometries and topologies to be analyzed. In this work, a numerical model for carbon fiber-reinforced bearings is implemented, calibrated, and validated and a set of virtual experiments is designed to investigate the behavior of the bearings under combined compressive and lateral loading. Special focus is paid to detailed modeling of the constituent materials. The elastomeric matrix is modeled using a phenomenological rheological model based on the hyperelastic formulation developed by Yeoh and nonlinear viscoelasticity. The model aims to account for the hysteretic nonlinear hyper-viscoelastic behavior using a rheological formulation that takes into consideration hyperelasticity and nonlinear viscoelasticity and is calibrated using a series of experiments, including uniaxial tension tests, planar tests, and relaxation tests. Special interest is paid to capturing the energy dissipated in the unbonded fiber-reinforced elastomeric bearing in an accurate manner. The agreement between the numerical results and the experimental data is assessed, and the influence of parameters such as shape factor, aspect ratio, vertical pressure, and fiber reinforcement orientation on stress distribution in the bearings as well as in the mechanical properties is discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

Accompanying these improvements is the ability to tailor the placement of fibers (intricate fiber steering) within a part to improve its performance for a given state of loading. AM is inherently well-suited for integration with optimization schemes, as the designer can send a geometrically complex model directly to the 3D printer for fabrication. This study investigates the printability and performance of three benchmark geometries and loading scenarios optimized for stiffness. These designs are achieved via topology (part geometry) and fiber placement optimization of AM continuous carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites. Some of the manufacturing constraints were implemented in the optimizer. Post-processing was, however, necessary to apply other AM constraints before parts could be successfully printed. The optimized designs were manufactured, on a printer built in-house, and tested in special load fixtures while parts’ displacements were recorded using digital image correlation (DIC). The stiffnesses found through experiments agreed with the finite element analysis (FEA). The optimized AM parts displayed up to 100% improvement in specific (per weight) stiffness, translating to a maximum of 50% weight reduction over conventional composite parts with unidirectional laminas. This study demonstrates that bridging topology and fiber path optimization with AM of continuous fiber-reinforced composites enables significant weight reduction that would otherwise be impossible. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Additive manufacturing; Continuous fiber composites; Fiber path optimization; Finite element analysis; Topology optimization","Additives; Benchmarking; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Finite element method; Geometry; Printing presses; Reinforcement; Stiffness; Topology; Composite parts; Continuous fiber composites; Continuous fibers; Fiber path; Fiber path optimization; Fibre-reinforced composite; Finite elements analysis; Manufacturing constraint; Performance; Topology optimisation; 3D printers","M.

Machining is often necessary as a post-processing step to get the CFRP parts in appropriate form. This research uses numerical modeling and simulation with ABAQUS/Explicit, a commercially available sophisticated finite element analysis (FEA) software program, to compare the machining behavior and post-processing capabilities of laminated and 3D printed CFRP composites. The effects of machining parameters, such as, feed, cutting speed and depth of cut (DOC), and 3D printing parameters like percentage of overlap between neighboring passes and layer heights, have been investigated. Cutting forces, strain, chip and burr development, and the consequent surface topology have all been used to assess the post-processing capability or machining behavior of CFRPs. A 3D model was built using appropriate damage initiation and propagations factors such as ductile and shear damage, as well as the Johnson-Cook criteria for plasticity. C3D8R elements, which are 8-node brick elements, were used to mesh each layer of the laminated workpiece model. For 3D printed models, linear tetrahedral elements, also known as C3D4T, were employed to capture changes in elemental level. The cutting and thrust forces generated increased as the DOC, cutting speed and feed rate increased. Chip formation was primarily controlled by stiffness and flute shape of the cutting tool, and 3D print direction. It was seen that the surface quality is better for laminated CFRPs. The highest cutting force obtained are found to have an essentially proportional correlation with feed, layer height, and spindle speed. Finally, the findings are persuasive, and they may be utilized to direct actual machining operations and achieve the required results.

To analyze the obtained design in terms of functionality, a material exchange technique that accounts for fiber orientation elementwise is employed. The robust design procedure is shown to be effective in developing PMH parts while considering injection molding (IM) restrictions from the early design stages. The PMH model provides a good balance between functionality and IM suitability, with a 36% weight reduction from the steel baseline model.

It typically consists in manipulating heavy parts or working in non-ergonomic conditions. The resulting work-related musculoskeletal disorders are a major problem to tackle. The most-affected body section is the the lumbar spine. Recently, exoskeletons have been identified as a possible non-invasive solution to reduce the impact of low-back pain. State-of-the-art prototypes have been optimized to: follow unconstrained human kinematics, (partially) relieve the load on assisted joints, and allow anthropometric adaptation. Yet, this technology still has limited adoption. Manufacturing optimization may address the following limitations: bulky/heavy resulting designs, complex assembly and maintenance, high manufacturing costs, long procedures for adaptation and wearing, and psychological effects (e.g., cognitive load and usability). In this contribution, the aforementioned issues are tackled improving a previous low-back exoskeleton prototype. In particular, kinematic analysis, Finite-Element-Method, and topological optimization have been combined to obtain a lightweight prototype, testing different materials (Nylon, carbon-fiber reinforced PC/ABS, etc.). We applied both Design for Assembly and Design for Manufacturability. The resulting exoskeleton prototype is described in the paper, ready for end-user field tests. © 2022 The Authors.

Thus, optimizing their microstructure is a powerful approach to reduce system costs. Here we present a pore network modeling framework that is microstructure and chemistry agnostic, iteratively solves transport equations in both half-cells, and utilizes a network-in-series approach to simulate the local transport phenomena within porous electrodes at a low computational cost. In this study, we critically assess the versatility and robustness of pore network models to enable the modeling of different electrode geometries and redox chemistries. To do so, the proposed model was validated with two commonly used carbon fiber-based electrodes (a paper and a cloth), by extracting topologically equivalent networks from X-ray tomograms, and evaluated for two model redox chemistries (an aqueous iron-based and a non-aqueous TEMPO-based electrolyte). We find that the modeling framework successfully captures the experimental performance of the non-aqueous electrolyte but is less accurate for the aqueous electrolyte which was attributed to incomplete wetting of the electrode surface in the conducted experiments. Furthermore, the validation reveals that care must be taken when extracting networks from the tomogram of the woven cloth electrode, which features a multiscale microstructure with threaded fiber bundles. Employing this pore network model, we elucidate structure-performance relationships by leveraging the performance profiles and the simulated local distributions of physical properties and finally, we deploy simulations to identify efficient operation envelopes. © 2022 Electrochemical Society Inc..

Herein, a facile cross-scale processing strategy is presented to construct commercially available nontoxic viscose fibers into fast responsive and humidity-driven yarn artificial muscles with a recorded torsional stroke of 1752° cm-1 and a maximum rotation speed up to 2100 rpm, which are comparable to certain artificial muscles made from carbon-based composite materials. The underlying mechanism of such outstanding actuation performance that begins to form at a mesoscale is discussed by theoretical modeling and microstructure characterization. The as-prepared yarn artificial muscles are further scaled up to large-sized fabric muscles through topological weaving structures by integrating different textile technologies. These fabric muscles extend the simple motion of yarn muscles into higher-level diverse deformations without any composite system, complex synthetic processing, and component design, which enables the development of new fiber-based artificial muscles for versatile applications, such as smart textiles and intelligent systems. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","actuators; artificial muscles; fabric muscles; humidity-responsive materials; smart textiles","Biomimetic Materials; Humans; Muscles; Particle Size; Robotics; Textiles; Cost engineering; Deformation; Fabrics; Fibers; Intelligent systems; Muscle; Smart textiles; Textile industry; Weaving; Wool; Yarn; biomimetic material; 'current; Artificial muscle; Fabric muscle; Flexible actuator; High costs; Humidity-responsive material; In-fiber; Performance; Responsive materials; Softer materials; chemistry; human; muscle; particle size; robotics; synthesis; textile; Actuators","F.

Saturable absorber (SA) technology is the most effective technique for the generation of ultra-fast lasers, which are based on artificial SAs and natural SAs. Among them, the semiconductor saturable absorber mirror has become the most commonly used form at present. Recently, basic research and application of nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphene have been developed rapidly. Researchers have found that nanomaterials exhibit extraordinary characteristics in ultrafast photonics, such as the low saturation intensity of CNTs, zero-band gap of graphene, and extremely high modulation depth of the topological insulator nano-films. Since graphene was first reported as an SA in 2009, many other nanomaterials have been successively explored, resulting in the rapid development of novel nanomaterial-based SAs. In this paper, we classified the nanomaterials used in SA mode-locking technology at 1.5 μm and reviewed their research progress with a particular focus on nonlinear optical properties, integration strategies, and applications in the field of ultrafast photonics. © 2022 IOP Publishing Ltd.","fiber laser; mode locked; nonlinear optics; saturable absorber; ultrafast","Carbon nanotubes; Continuous wave lasers; Diagnosis; Energy gap; Fiber lasers; Graphene; Mode-locked fiber lasers; Nonlinear optics; Optical properties; Semiconductor quantum wells; Ultrafast lasers; Ultrashort pulses; 1.5 μm; Continuous-wave lasers; High peak power; Medical diagnostics; Mode-locked; Passive mode-locked fiber lasers; Precision machining; Ultra-fast; Ultra-fast photonics; Ultra-high; Saturable absorbers","Y.

Advancements in additive manufacturing (AM) can enable such designs to be manufactured. Specifically, the use of continuous carbon fiber-reinforced plastics (CFRPs) in AM or automated fiber placement (AFP) allows for 3D printing of such topology and fiber path optimized designs. However, fiber path optimization methods generally result in a collection of fibers in loops (closed loops) that are impossible to print, and lines (open loops), which may be too short to print depending on the system. Additionally, placement of discontinuities, i.e., where a fiber path ends inside a part, can result in stress concentrations that degrade the part performance. This paper introduces an approach to automatically convert the collection of closed and open loops into printable set(s) of fibers. An additional optional consideration of stress concenterations can be provided to the algorithm, which is demonstrated using finite element analysis (FEA) for enhanced structural performance. © Proceedings of the American Society for Composites - 37th Technical Conference, ASC 2022.

The mechanical properties and elastic isotropy of representative truss–lattices composed of struts and plate–lattices consisting of closed-cell sheets were firstly evaluated, based on which the equivalent out-of-plane compression modulus of the hierarchical pyramidal structure was theoretically analysed and then compared with experimental and numerical results to systematically clarify the effects of lattice topology on the structural performance. Furthermore, the elementary lattice exhibiting the optimal structural efficiency and elastic isotropy was integrated with HMTO to optimize the out-of-plane compression properties including stiffness and energy absorption capability. The hierarchical pyramidal structure with optimal structural hierarchy achieves 4.8% and 28.2% higher compressive modulus over the conventional pyramidal structure and unoptimized hierarchical pyramidal structure, respectively. The energy absorption capability of optimized and unoptimized hierarchical pyramidal structures is 63.4% and 27.2% higher than that of conventional pyramidal structure without structural hierarchy, respectively.

Incorporating phenylphosphine oxide (PPO) groups into polymer chains offers a self-regenerating method of protection from AO but remains poorly understood. Herein, epoxies containing PPO groups were synthesized with increasing concentrations of phosphorus [P] from 0 to 8 wt % to investigate their AO resistance. Thin films of PPO-containing epoxies were exposed to AO via oxygen plasma etching and characterized by interferometry, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and atomic force microscopy-infrared spectroscopy. Measurements confirmed that the exposure of these materials to AO produces a passivation phosphate (POx) layer on the surface of the sample, resulting in up to 100X decrease in AO erosion rates. Furthermore, key insights into the relationship between initial [P], passivation layer surface topology, and polymer depth profiles were obtained. Crucially, the results indicate that these materials advantageously did not exhibit linear erosion rates when exposed to AO, in contrast to most organic polymers, and their AO resistance can be readily tuned via synthetic incorporation of monomers with varying [P].  © ","atomic oxygen; epoxy; phenylphosphine oxide; space composites; thermoset polymers","Amines; Atomic force microscopy; Chlorine containing polymers; Communication satellites; Erosion; Graphite fibers; Infrared spectroscopy; Orbits; Oxygen; Passivation; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Low earth orbits; Oxygen plasma etching; Passivation layer; Phenylphosphine oxides; Polymer chains; Spacecraft operation; Stable polymers; Surface topology; Organic polymers","J.

Mass reduction is the most practical method to increase fuel economy of a vehicle. New materials and CAE technology allow for lightweight automotive components to be designed and manufactured, which outperform traditional component designs. Topology optimization and other design optimization techniques are widely used by designers to create lightweight structural automotive parts. Other design optimization techniques include free-size, gauge, and size optimization. These optimization techniques are typically used in sequence or independently during the design process. Performing various types of design optimization simultaneously is only practical in certain cases, where different parts of the structure have different manufacturing constraints. This paper presents a case where this simultaneous optimization approach is used to redesign an automotive front crossmember using carbon fiber sheet moulding compound and carbon fiber non-crimp fabric. This method is successful in producing a design that is 50#x00025; lighter than its existing steel counterpart, while maintaining equal stiffness to the steel design. © 2022 SAE International.

The goal is to study the surface evolution of the materials in terms of chemical composition and morphology. Plasma treatment is applied on new and hygrothermally aged samples in order to analyse its contribution to the surface modifications and degradations. It appears that hygrothermal ageing has irreversible absorption behaviour causing hydrolysis, oxidation and particle losses, which modifies the surface chemistry and topology. On the other hand, the atmospheric plasma causes oxidation of the matrix. Indeed, when a repair is necessary, the damaged part could evolve due to moisture absorption related to ageing. As the fibres are exposed, the topology and surface chemistry are modified. Nevertheless, it allows to desorb the humidity adsorbed on the surface and reach an oxidation level similar to unaged treated samples. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric plasma; Carbon/epoxy composite; Hygrothermal ageing; Particle migration; Pre-bond ageing; Surface chemistry; Surface functionalization","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric humidity; Carbon; Composite materials; Degradation; Electric discharges; Morphology; Oxidation; Plasma applications; Surface chemistry; Atmospheric plasma treatments; Atmospheric plasmas; Carbon-epoxy; Carbon-epoxy composite; Composites material; Hygrothermal; Hygrothermal ageing; Particle migration; Pre-bond aging; Surface Functionalization; Topology","C.

The passive mode-locking method with saturable absorber (SA) is the most widely used technology. To realize passive mode-locking, the key research field is to explore high-performance broadband saturable absorber materials with long term stability, easy fabrication, low cost, and high damage threshold in passive mode-locked fiber lasers. This chapter introduces the optical properties of these new type broadband saturable absorbers materials, such as carbon nanotubes (CNTs), graphene, topological insulators, two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorus (BP). The main topics include increasing the damage threshold, improving the fabrication technology, and reducing the nonsaturable losses, as well as fabricating different types of new saturable absorbers devices and the ones used for mode-locked fiber lasers, that is: Constructing a fiber laser with single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) heavy water solution as saturable absorber. The saturable intensity and the modulation depth of the proposed saturable absorber device are evaluated to be 20 MW/cm2 and 5.7%, respectively. The nonsaturable loss is evaluated to be 3%. By incorporating the saturable absorber into Yb-doped fiber laser cavities with 2 nm and 8 nm bandpass filters, respectively, two mode-locked fiber lasers are achieved with central wavelengths of 1053.45 nm and 1054.16 nm. The pulse duration is measured to be 512 ps and 194 ps, respectively. The mode-locked fiber laser with 2 nm bandpass filter generates the pulse with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 50 dB and the mode-locked fiber laser with 8 nm bandpass filter generates pulse with SNR of 60 dB. Fabricating the Bi2Te3/polyvinylalcohol (PVA) and tapered fiber Bi2Te3 saturable absorbers, respectively. The Bi2Te3/PVA saturable absorber is fabricated by liquid phase exfoliation method and the tapered fiber Bi2Te3 saturable absorber is fabricated by pulsed laser deposition technology. The modulation depth and tapered fiber Bi2Te3 saturable absorbers are measured to be 8.4% and 10%, respectively. By incorporating the two kinds of saturable absorbers into Yb-doped fiber laser cavities, two mode-locked fiber lasers with pulse durations of 417 ps and 317 psare achieved. Fabricating the WS2/fluorine mica (FM) saturable absorber and DF-WS2 solution saturable absorber (SSA). The WS2/FM SA is fabricated with thermal decomposition method by depositing WS2 layers onto 20 μm thickness of one-layer FM. The WS2/FM SA has a high damage threshold of 406 MW/cm2, two times higher than that of WS2/PVA. The modulation depth and nonsaturable losses of WS2/FM are measured to be 5.8% and 14.8%, respectively, at 1 μm region. By incorporating the WS2/FM into Yb-doped fiber laser cavity, a mode-locked fiber laser is achieved with central wavelength of 1052.45 nm. The maximum average output power is 30 mW. The modulation depth and nonsaturable loss of WS2/FM SA are measured to be 3.1% and 15%, respectively, at 1.55 μm region. By employing the WS2/FM SA, a stable conventional soliton Er-doped mode-locked fiber laser is achieved. The repetition rate is 8.2 MHz and the pulse duration is 830 fs. The DF-WS2 SSA is fabricated based on a D-shaped fiber embedded in WS2nanosheet solution. This kind of SA shows a modulation depth of 11%, a saturable intensity of 5 MW/cm2, and a nonsaturable loss of 18% at 1.55 μm region. By incorporating this kind of saturable absorber into EDF laser cavity, stable fundamental mode-locking operation is achieved with pulse duration of 670 fs at low pump power. 460.7 MHz harmonic mode-locking operation is also achieved at high pump power, and the pulse duration and SNR are measured to be 710 fs and 66 dB, respectively. Fabricating the black phosphorus solution saturable absorber with D-shaped fiber (DF-BP SSA). The saturable absorber is fabricated based on a DF embedded in BP nanosheets N-Methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solution. Such a BP solution method has virtues of good anti-oxidant capacity, high heat dissipation, and high damage threshold. This kind of saturable absorber shows a modulation depth of 7.75% and nonsaturable loss of 10% at 1.55 μm region. By employing DF-BP SSA, a repetition rate of 15.2 MHz mode-locked fiber laser is achieved. The pulse duration is 580 fs and the SNR is 65 dB. © 2022 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","","","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85140678200"

However, traditional joint topologies such as single overlap joints induce high peel stresses, resulting in sudden failure and low joint strength when compared to metal adherends. This drawback in using carbon fiber reinforced polymer is hindering their performance and efficiency in full-scale structures where joints are essential. The goal of this paper is to review how the joint design can help to improve the lap shear strength of composite bonded joints, to recognize the challenges that still need to be understood and to give insight into new opportunities. The focus is thereby on means to increase the matrix-dominated out-of-plane strength of the adherend in order to postpone delamination failure, as it is known to be the most prone type of failure of composite bonded joints. The paper is divided in two main parts: firstly, a review of topology-related and material-related design parameters is given and secondly, future opportunities to improve out-of-plane strength of CFRP bonded joints yet to be explored are discussed. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adhesive bonding; Composite joints; Joint topology; Review","Adhesive joints; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Fiber bonding; Joining; Reinforcement; Reviews; Topology; Adherends; Adhesively bonded lap joint; Adhesives bonding; Aerospace structure; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Composite bonded joints; Composite joint; Joining technology; Joint topology; Out-of-plane; Adhesives","S.

To solve these problems, a degradable Epoxidized menthane diamine–adipic acid (EMDA–AA) vitrimer matrix for CFRPs is obtained from bio-based menthane diamine and adipic acid. Owing to the rigid six-membered ring structure of EMDA, the EMDA–AA vitrimer matrix exhibits good mechanical properties. With the autocatalysis of tertiary amines in the EMDA–AA vitrimer, the vitrimer network can achieve topological rearrangement via dynamic transesterification reactions without additional catalysts. The fabricated vitrimer exhibits excellent self-healing, shape memory and reprocessing properties. Moreover, EMDA–AA–CF composite with EMDA–AA epoxy vitrimer as the matrix resin shows excellent reprocessing, shape memory and self-adhesive properties. In addition, the EMDA–AA vitrimer matrix resin can be rapidly degraded into polyols by amination reaction with ethanolamine under mild conditions, resulting in the efficient recycling of Carbon fibers (CFs). Scanning electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and tensile tests show that the recycled CFs have almost the same chemical structure and mechanical properties as the virgin CFs. This study can assist in the preparation of green and high-strength CFRPs using recyclable bio-based epoxy vitrimer matrices and provide a strategy for efficient recycling of CFs from CFRPs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bio-based vitrimer; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Catalyst-free; Menthane diamine; Recycling","Adhesives; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Catalysts; Epoxy resins; Recycling; Reinforcement; Resins; Scanning electron microscopy; Self-healing materials; Tensile testing; Adipic acids; Bio-based; Bio-based vitrimer; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Catalyst-free; matrix; Menthane diamine; Recyclables; Self-healing; Shape-memory; Amines","H.

A lay-up with an array of pins is then subjected to a hot-press process flattening the pin ends resulting in a consolidated preform. This preform exhibits useful characteristics such as the ability to be cut and reformed to a new topology, with the through thickness reinforcement also conforming to the new shape.

The trapezoidal and sinusoidal two-dimensional double arrow carbon fiber composite sandwich structures were fabricated by molding and autoclave process. The vibration frequency response curves of the structures were obtained by frequency sweep test with shaking table. The three-dimensional finite element model of the structure was established and compared with the experimental results to verify the accuracy of the simulation model. Based on this, the effects of cell thickness, angle, topological configuration and thickness gradient on the vibration characteristics and damping performance of the structure were systematically studied. The results show that with the increase of the thickness and angle of the core cell, the natural frequency of the structure increases, the peak value of the acceleration response decreases, and the damping performance of the structure improves. Compared with the sinusoidal structure, the trapezoidal structure usually has higher natural frequency and better damping performance. Compared with other uniform and gradient structures, the weakening structure has better damping performance. © 2022 Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA).

To date, high thermal conductivity has been only achieved in specific pitch-based CFs with high crystallinity. However, obtaining high graphitic crystallinity and high thermal conductivity beyond pitch-CFs remains a grand challenge. Here, a 2D-topology-seeded graphitization method is presented to mediate the topological incompatibility in graphitization by seeding 2D graphene oxide (GO) sheets into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m−1 K−1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude higher in conductivity than commercial PAN-based CFs. The self-oxidation and seeded graphitization effect generate large crystallite size and high orientation to far exceed those of conventional CFs. Topologically seeded graphitization, verified in experiments and simulations, allows conversion of the non-graphitizable into graphitizable materials by incorporating 2D seeds. This method extends the preparation of highly thermally conductive CFs, which has great potential for lightweight thermal-management materials. © 2022 Wiley-VCH GmbH.","2D seeds; carbon fibers; graphene oxide; high thermal conductivity; topology-graphitization","Crystallinity; Crystallite size; Graphene; Graphite; Graphitization; Thermal conductivity; Topology; 2d seed; Conductive carbon fiber; Cristallinity; Grand Challenge; High crystallinity; High thermal conductivity; Mechanical; Pitch based carbon fiber; Polyacrylonitrile precursors; Topology-graphitization; Carbon fibers","Y.

Here, continuous carbon fibers inside a base structure improve the strength and stiffness in the fiber direction. For CFRP-AM fabrication, it is important to design the structure with some consideration of the carbon fiber arrangement. This study aimed to propose a design optimization method for CFRP-AM. The target structure is a two-dimensional infill pattern structure that is lightweight, has a low volume, and easily fabricated using CFRP-AM. To optimize the infill structure and the carbon fiber arrangement, we represented the structure as a geometric graph and discretized for restraining computational costs. We encoded these aspects into a chromosome composed of binary genes considering a continuity of carbon fibers and optimized them using a genetic algorithm. To explain the proposed method's effect, we conducted case studies using a cantilever beam. The first involved optimizing the carbon fiber arrangement to reinforce the structure with less fiber and reduce material costs. The second involved simultaneously optimizing the infill structure and the carbon fiber arrangement to reduce both the base materials and the carbon fiber while retaining the high strength. Following this, we applied the proposed method to optimizing a 3-point bending structure. In addition, the proposed method was applied to designing a bicycle brake lever and the optimized structures were fabricated with CFRP-AM. The results confirmed that the proposed optimization method would be useful in the area of CFRP-AM fabrication. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Additive manufacturing; CFRP; Design optimization; Genetic algorithm; Infill structure","3D printers; Additives; Bending strength; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Chromosomes; Fabrication; Fibers; Infill drilling; Shape optimization; Stiffness; Structural optimization; Continuous fibers; Design optimization; Fiber arrangement; Fiber path; High-strength; Infill structure; Material cost; Optimization method; Pattern structure; Simultaneous optimization; Genetic algorithms","K.

Given the recent interest in their mechanical performance and failure mechanisms, this work aims to describe the principal failure mechanisms and compare the prediction capabilities for the mechanical properties, stiffness constants, and strength of cFRAM using two distinct predictive models. This work presents experimental tensile tests of continuous carbon fiber AM composites varying their reinforced fraction, printing direction, and fiber angle. In the first predictive model, a micromechanical-based model for stiffness and strength predicts their macroscopic response. In the second part, data-driven models using different machine learning algorithms for regression are trained to predict stiffness and strength based on critical parameters. Both models are assessed regarding their accuracy, ease of implementation, and generalization capabilities. Moreover, microstructural images are used for a qualitative evaluation of the parameters and their influence on the macroscopic response and failure surface topology. Finally, we conclude that although predicting the mechanical properties of cFRAM is a complex task, it can be carried on a Gaussian process regression and a micromechanical model, with good accuracy generalized onto different process parameters specimens. © 2022 by the authors.","additive manufacturing; fractographic analysis; machine learning; micromechanics; thermoplastic composites","3D printers; Additives; Carbon fibers; Failure (mechanical); Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Mechanisms; Parameter estimation; Reinforced plastics; Stiffness; Tensile testing; Thermoplastics; Comparison of models; Continuous fibers; Failure mechanism; Fibre-reinforced; Fractographic analysis; Machine-learning; Macroscopic response; Mechanical properties of polymers; Predictive models; Thermoplastic composite; Machine learning","O.A.

To achieve this mining capability, sandwich composites offer an optimum structure for space mining vehicles due to their relatively high strength and stiffness compared to their weight. The challenge of designing such structures is often hampered by the lack of design approaches for practicing engineers in the mining industry usually lacking the composite material expertise or access to significant test capabilities. Expanding the use of sandwich composite materials into this industry requires selection charts that fully define the material system for a design engineer. Currently there is no methodology that systematically allows a design engineer to define a material system that uses carbon fiber reinforced plastics with aluminum honeycomb cores. The purpose of this paper is to introduce novel selection charts that allow an engineer to define the number of plies, stacking sequence, core thickness, and core density of a sandwich composite based off the moment carrying capacity. An example implementation of this approach is conducted using a carbon-fiber/epoxy with an aluminum alloy 5052 core. The selection charts developed with this approach are than validated with experimental analysis in accordance with ASTM D7249 (Standard Test Method for Facing Properties of Sandwich Construction by Long Beam Flexure). Experimental results show strong correlation with the selection charts by predicting the available moment and the mode of failure. Such selection charts will help facilitate wider use of these materials into industries that do not currently use them. Additionally, a novel numerical modeling approach for thick section sandwich composites using 3D finite elements is introduced. This approach shows how sandwich composite facesheets can be modeled with standard 3D elements instead of elements that support layers. Such an approach allows access to a wider variety of elements and is conducive to rapid design iterations when topological changes are occurring such as in a research and development environment. It is shown that numerical results correlate well with experimental data when using a linear-elastic isotropic core model with bilinear isotropic plasticity. © 2021 IAA","Aluminum honeycomb; Carbon fiber; Finite elements; Sandwich composites; Selection chart","Aluminum alloys; Earth (planet); Elastomers; Graphic methods; Honeycomb structures; Reinforcement; Structural optimization; Testing; Aluminium honeycomb; Aluminum honeycomb cores; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Composites material; Core design; Design engineers; Design Methodology; Material systems; Sandwich composites; Selection chart; Finite element method","P.

TO allows designers to generate lightweight, non-intuitive solutions that often improve overall system performance. Utilization of multiple materials within TO expands its range of applications, granting additional freedom and structural performance to designers. Often, use of multiple materials in TO results in material placement that may not have been previously identified as optimal, providing designers with the ability to produce novel high performance systems. As numerous modern engineering materials possess anisotropic properties, a logical extension of multi-material TO is to include provisions for anisotropic materials. Herein lies the focus of this work. A TO algorithm capable of considering anisotropic material properties is used to investigate a case study on the design of an automotive hood panel. A baseline aluminum hood panel is used to generate stiffness targets for optimization, followed by the generation of a design space model to allow the algorithm to determine optimal material placement. Optimization is undertaken with two types of AS4 continuous carbon fiber reinforced epoxy, each in two orientations. Optimal hood panel solutions that maintain stiffness levels of the conventional baseline are achieved. The mass of the design space is minimized, and constrained through the baseline displacement values. The effect of hood panel thickness and offset distance between panel layers is also investigated. The optimal topologies indicated an overall mass savings of up to 44.5% in relation to the baseline, while maintaining hood panel stiffness. Comparative mass savings decreased as hood panel thickness increased and offset distance decreased. The allocation of stiffer materials was observed near locations of applied loads and constraints, with highly anisotropic materials placed along hood panel extremities. The practicality of anisotropic multi-material TO in lightweight design was thus demonstrated. © 2021 SAE International; General Motors.","","Aerospace industry; Graphite fibers; Optical anisotropy; Stiffness; Structural design; Topology; Anisotropic material; Anisotropic material properties; Anisotropic property; Carbon fiber reinforced; Displacement value; High performance systems; Optimal topologies; Structural performance; Computer aided engineering","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85104841905"

First, a two-stage topological design procedure is established to acquire the optimal topology for confining maximum stress and minimising structural compliance. Second, based on calculations for the average load transmission trajectories within the optimal topology, continuous carbon fibre placement paths are defined for 3D-printing with fused filament fabrication (FFF). Experimental studies are performed for topologically designed short cantilever and three-point-bending specimens to characterise the reinforcement effect of short carbon fibre (SCF, vol% = 15%) and continuous carbon fibre (CCF, vol% = 35%) on specimens printed with pure polyamide (PA). The CCF increases the stiffness and the magnitude of peak load of the cantilever specimens by 1198% and 1633%, respectively, while the increments are 569% and 293%, respectively, for three-point-bending specimens, showing the significant impact of the procedure. The SCF also increases the stiffness and peak load of the both structural configurations but to a much lesser degree. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Additive manufacturing; Carbon fibre; Fibre placement; Load transmission trajectories; Polyamide; Topology optimisation","Bending (deformation); Bending dies; Composite structures; Design; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Nanocantilevers; Stiffness; Topology; Transmissions; Carbon fibre reinforced composites; Load transmission; Optimal topologies; Reinforcement effects; Short carbon fibres; Structural configurations; Three-point bending specimens; Topological design; 3D printers","L.

However, such parts need to be joined with various metal alloys to obtain better mechanical performance in many structural elements. Many studies have reported enhancements in polymer–metal bonding using adhesives, adhesive/rivet combined joints, and different surface treatments. This study investigated the influences of various surface treatments on the adhesion between glass-reinforced poly(phenylene) sulphide (PPS) and aluminium alloy during the injection over-moulding process. Adhesion strength was evaluated via the shear test. Correlations for the shear strength of the polymer–metal with different metal–substrate treatments were studied. Since the strongest bonding was attained in the treatment with the highest roughness, this value, as it determines the level of micromechanical interlocking of connected materials, seems to be a critical factor affecting the adhesion strength. Three-dimensional (3D) topographic images characterized with a 3D optical microscope indicated that there was a meaningful influence exerted by the interface topologies of the aluminium substrates used for the over-moulding process. The results further indicated that increases in a substrate’s surface energy in connection with atmospheric plasma treatments negatively influence the final level of the bonding mechanism. © 2022 by the authors.

Longitudinal tensile strengths of CC-AM have been reported exceeding 1500 MPa with minimal porosity, making this system a candidate for scale-up and structural applications. However, there remain a number of morphological non-idealities that are unique to the CC-AM process that limit the performance of a complex AM build. These can be categorized into material non-idealities (fiber clustering, resin-rich zones, matrix quality) and topological constraint non-idealities (joint design constraints, minimum path radius, tow cuts). Furthermore, for UV snap-cured carbon fiber CC-AM, limited penetration of the UV radiation through the carbon fiber tow presents a challenge to achieving optimal in-situ curing. The present work lays out these challenges both in a general sense, with specific case examples for material built with the CF3D system (Continuous Composites Inc.) using T-1100 12K carbon fiber tows and a UV snap curing acrylate resin. Most of the issues highlighted are inherent to CC-AM, and so most of the recommendations for future development to mitigate the various non-idealities are expected to translate to other CC-AM technologies, such as those employing a thermoplastic polymer matrix. © Proceedings of the American Society for Composites - 37th Technical Conference, ASC 2022.

Sandwich panels have been manufactured with carbon/fiber epoxy composite face sheets, polyurethane rigid foam core or 3D printed PLA plastic cellular honeycombs head (hexagonal, re-entrant, hexachiral and arrowhead). The material properties of the constituents have been determined via tensile and compression tests. The cellular core topologies have the same wall thickness and number of cells (39x4, except for the hexachiral topology). A rigid striker with a hemispherical head tip is dropped on the specimens with a speed of 2.6 m/s. Explicit finite element (FE) models are validated by the experimental results. Parametric numerical analyses using the validated FE have been carried out with different impact energies of 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 76 J to identify the best core designs. The results show that non-auxetic cores could have advantages over the auxetic ones at small deformation (impact energy is equal to 10 J) thanks to the larger contact surface and higher thickness of the cellular structure. The auxetic core, however, provides greater impact resistance and energy absorption capability as the impact energy increases due to the larger densification and lower indentation during collapse. The arrowhead-based panels in particular possess 25%, 13% and 11% larger crash efficiency than the other samples for impacts with 50, 60 and 76 J. The hexachiral lattice provides the best performance at 10, 20 and 30 J, and also possesses advantages over the other cellular configurations (except for the arrowhead core) in the case of 40, 50, 60 and 76 J impact loading. As a result, the arrowhead and hexachiral configurations are those mostly recommended for applications involving impacts under large deformations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Double arrowhead; Hexachiral honeycombs; Impact resistance; Mechanical metamaterial; Polyurethane foam; Re-entrant; Sandwich panel","3D printers; Compression testing; Deformation; Impact resistance; Polyurethanes; Sandwich structures; Topology; Auxetics; Composite sandwich panels; Core structure; Double arrowhead; Hexachiral honeycomb; Impact energy; Mechanical metamaterial; Polyurethane Foam; Re-entrant; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","F.

However, only by taking coupled physics effects of the disciplines aerodynamics, structures and flight dynamics into account already at the early design stage, technologies like gust and maneuver load alleviation can be evaluated and their effect on the global aircraft shape can be assessed. By using such an improved model, possible benefits in overall aircraft efficiency can be identified. This paper presents a process for the integration of flight control and aero-elasticity into conceptual aircraft design, using the software ASWING‡ for performing an unsteady lifting-line calculation combined with non-linear Euler beam theory. Results are shown for a long-range transport aircraft design. Maneuver load cases are evaluated. A simplified 2.5D-method sizes the wing box based on a carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer topology and a set of load cases. A five-dimensional planform geometry design space, containing up to 756 aircraft designs is considered. For the design space three studies are evaluated without any load alleviation, with maneuver load alleviation and with an academic approach of a global load reduction factor. The presented process enables the assessment of how load reduction and layouts affect the aircraft design. In the design process loop the wing parameters are fed into an overall aircraft design process. This resulting global aircraft design is, in contrast to the more detailed wing sizing, based on handbook methods. The block fuel for the design mission is the main parameter for evaluating the expected benefits. Certain geometrical constraints for the tank volume, the installation space and the span limit are discussed. The findings reflect a combined maximum load alleviation and shape optimization potential in block fuel of approximately 20 % without further constraints. For the geometrically constrained design space the maximum block fuel benefit is 13.3 % compared to the reference aircraft. The main effect of the load alleviation technology in conceptual aircraft design is to enable more efficient configurations within the constrained design space. © 2022, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The analysis was performed using working curves and optical methods. A comparison between the two fiber types showed that using glass fibers leads to increased volume efficiency, which improved even more with increasing fiber weight fraction. The fiber length showed no significant influence. Superlogarithmic curing behavior under high exposure doses can be significantly reduced by using either fiber types. The increased volume efficiency compared to the pure photopolymer of glass fiber-filled photopolymers leads to a broadening in the xy-plane due to light scattering. In the case of carbon fibers, the effect is reduced, but with higher fiber weight fraction the achievable cure depth is strongly limited. The derivation of the exposure parameters for an accurate fabrication with fibers has been validated by a topology-optimized lightweight structure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Chopped fibers; Milled fibers; Photopolymerization; SFRP; Working curves","Curing; Efficiency; Light scattering; Photopolymerization; Chopped fiber; Curing behavior; Fiber types; Glass-fibers; Milled fibers; Photopolymerizations; SFRP; Volume efficiency; Weight fractions; Working curve; Glass fibers","T.

In this study, an anisotropic micro/nano composite topography scaffolds containing functionalized multi-walled carbon nanotube(CNT) with YIGSR (YR) and deferoxamine (DFO) was developed by combining use of micro-molding and electrospinning technologies, which is the so-called micro-molded electrospinning (MME). The scaffolds displayed composite topology structure, with randomly-oriented nanofibers and parallel-oriented micro-ridge/grooves, enhanced mechanical properties, and good photo-thermal responsiveness, and could guide the orientation growth of Schwann cells, promote the axon elongation of dorsal root ganglion in vitro. The in vivo evaluation indicated that the developed scaffolds obviously enhanced vascularization, inhibited inflammatory reaction and effectively accelerated the long-distance nerve regeneration with good functional recovery. Further on, the transcriptome sequencing revealed that the YR/DFO@DCNT functionalized anisotropic micro/nano composite scaffolds could upregulate the expression of MET, MPZ and TAZ, which were closely associate with neural cell migration and survival, myelination and cytoskeleton rearrangement for axon elongation and nerve regeneration.

Its low topology freezing transition temperature (∼130 °C) and responsiveness to moisture make polyimine suitable for recycling, reprocessing, and repairing under mild processing conditions. Here, we demonstrate the rapid fabrication of carbon fiber-reinforced polyimine composites and their unique properties. Using a powder-based compression molding method, we are able to fabricate carbon fiber-reinforced polyimine within ∼4 min. The resulting composites exhibit similar mechanical properties as the samples prepared through much slower liquid-based impregnation method (>24 h). We also demonstrate in situ, mold-free repair of polyimine composites with a curved surface at low temperature and pressure (∼75 °C, implemented by a handheld iron for 5 min). The malleability, weldability, and full recyclability of polyimine composites fabricated by the powder-based method are also demonstrated. These unique properties offer great promise for expanding the manufacturing capability and extending the service life of fiber-reinforced composites.  © ","fiber-reinforced composites; in situ repair; polyimine; rapid fabrication; recycling; welding","Compression molding; Fabrication; Fibers; Moisture; Recycling; Reinforcement; Repair; Temperature; %moisture; Carbon fiber reinforced; Fibre-reinforced; Fibre-reinforced composite; In situ repair; Polyimines; Powder-based; Property; Rapid fabrication; Recyclability; Fiber reinforced plastics","R.

To improve the poor magnetic property of carbon nanofibers, the introduction of magnetic nanoparticles into carbon nanofibers has been proved to be an ideal strategy. Herein, novel Carbon Nanotubes/Polyacrylonitrile@NiFe based Layered Double Hydroxides composites (CNTs/PAN@NiFe-LDH) are fabricated by in-situ growth of NiFe-LDH on carbon nanotubes/polyacrylonitrile (CNTs/PAN) fibers. Impressively, layered double hydroxide can transform into nanoparticles through topological transformation process, and, the short carbon nanofibers containing NiFe alloy and NiFe2O4 particles (NiFe@CNF-x composites) are obtained at different calcination temperatures. Plenty of interfaces between the alloy promote charge separation and electrons transfer, helping to enhance interfacial polarization and related relaxation. The as-synthesized NiFe@CNF-x composites exhibit superior electromagnetic wave absorption property. Remarkably, NiFe@CNF-900 possesses a minimum reflection loss (RL) of − 49.5 dB at a relatively thin thickness of 1.4 mm, and a broad effective absorption bandwidth (RL<−10 dB) of 4.72 GHz appears at 1.5 mm. The superior microwave absorption performance is mainly ascribed to the unique structural design, appropriate impedance matching and enhanced microwave attenuation ability. The as-synthesized NiFe@CNF-x composites are promising candidates for electromagnetic wave absorption materials with low filler loading and small thickness. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electrospinning; Layered double hydroxide; Topological transformation","Binary alloys; Carbon nanotubes; Circular waveguides; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Electromagnetic waves; Iron alloys; Magnetic nanoparticles; Structural design; Topology; Calcination temperature; Charge separations; Effective absorption; Electromagnetic wave absorber; Interfacial polarization; Layered double hydroxides; Microwave attenuation; Topological transformation; Carbon nanofibers","W.

Yet, a deep understanding of this mechanical defense is still lacking. Here, we investigate the chela of hermit crab, Coenobita brevimanus, and establish the relationships between the microstructures, chemical compositions and mechanical properties to gain insights into its biomechanical functions. We find that the chela is a multi-layered shell composed of five different layers with distinct features of the microstructures and chemical compositions, conferring different mechanical properties. Especially, an increase of the calcium carbonate content towards the layer furthest from the exterior, unlike the chemical gradients of many crustacean exoskeletons, provides a strong resistance to deformation. Nanoindentation measurements reveal that the overall gradient of the elastic modulus and hardness in the cross-section displays a sandwich profile, i.e., a soft core clamped by two stiff surface layers. Further mechanics modeling demonstrates that the high curvature and stiff innermost sublayer enhance the structural rigidity of the chela. In conjunction with the experimental observations, dynamic finite element analysis maps the time-spatial distribution of principal stress and indicates that fiber bridging might be the major mechanism against crack propagation at microscale. The lessons gained from the study of this multiphase biological composite could provide important insights into the design and fabrication of bioinspired materials for structural applications. Statement of significance: Multiple hierarchical structures have been discovered in a variety of exoskeletons. They are naturally designed to maintain the structural integrity and act as a protective layer for the animals. However, each kind of the hierarchical structures has its unique topology, chemical gradients as well as mechanical properties. We find that the chela is multi-layered shell composed of five different layers with distinct features of the microstructures and chemical compositions, conferring different mechanical properties. Especially, a large amount of helicoidal organic fibrils form highly organized 3D woven matrix in the innermost layer, providing a strong mechanical resistance to avoid catastrophic failure. The overall gradient of the elastic modulus and hardness in the cross-section display a sandwich profile, effectively minimizing the stress concentration and deformation. The lessons gained from the multiscale design strategy of the chela provide important insights into the design and fabrication of bioinspired materials. © 2021","Chemical gradient; Crack propagation; Hierarchical structure; Laminate; Mechanical properties","Animals; Anomura; Calcium Carbonate; Elastic Modulus; Finite Element Analysis; Hardness; Calcium carbonate; Crack propagation; Cracks; Deformation; Elastic moduli; Hardness; Shellfish; Structural properties; alcohol; calcium; calcium carbonate; carbon; carbonic acid; carotenoid; chitin; glutaraldehyde; liquid nitrogen; magnesium; oxygen; Bio-inspired materials; Chemical compositions; Chemical gradients; Cracks propagation; Different layers; Hermit crabs; Hierarchical structures; Mechanical; Multi-layered shells; Multi-scale design; adult; Article; chemical composition; Coenobita brevimanus; controlled study; electron microscopy; elemental analysis; finite element analysis; hermit crab; male; micro-computed tomography; nonhuman; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; room temperature; sputter deposition; surface property; Young modulus; animal; Anomura; hardness; Microstructure","Z.

The radial basis function (RBF) is employed to construct the level set function (LSF). Fiber orientations are parameterized by LSF and fiber paths can be determined instinctively for the inherent advantages of the level set approach. Besides, the fast-marching method is employed to extrapolate the primary fiber paths to the secondary fiber paths, which can avoid the manufacturing drawbacks such as gaps and overlaps to a large extent. A detection and filtering technique is proposed here to alleviate the orientation disorder at the intersection of the diffusion surfaces. Two design schemes are developed to optimize both structural topology and fiber path. In a sequential procedure, topology optimization is conducted first with isotropic materials; and then fiber paths are optimized on the basis of fixed topological boundary. In a simultaneous optimization procedure, structural boundaries and fiber paths are optimized alternately through two inner loops. In this study, three numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, and the results show that optimization of fiber path is beneficial to improvement of structural performance. In general, the simultaneous optimization scheme exhibits better optimal outcome in comparison with the sequential optimization scheme. © 2022","Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) composites; Fiber path optimization; Level set method; Manufacturing constraints; Topology optimization","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Drop breakup; Fibers; Image segmentation; Level measurement; Manufacture; Numerical methods; Radial basis function networks; Topology; Carbon-fiber reinforced plastic composites; Composites structures; Fiber path; Fiber path optimization; Level set approach; Level Set method; Manufacturing constraint; Optimisations; Path optimizations; Topology optimisation; Shape optimization","Q.

Reactive plasma discharges modify these properties of composite surfaces and can improve adhesion. However, the outcome depends upon the specific composite-adhesive used, which is likely due to a subtle difference in the formulation of these components. Here, we select a model system widely used for aerospace applications (T300 composites formed by the combination of T300 fiber, Cycom 934 epoxy resin, and FM377 adhesives) to investigate the influence of oxygen (O2) plasma treatments on the topology and chemistry of composite surfaces and the differences in mechanical strengths correlated to these changes. Lap shear tests show that shear strengths increase by 10% because of low-pressure O2 plasma treatments. These plasma treatments increase surface roughness by 2-fold, which may improve mechanical modes of interlocking at composite-adhesive interfaces. Chemical analysis of composite surfaces by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) shows that treated composites expose a greater number of imide moieties (N 1s binding energies near 400.7 eV), and reactive titrations with fluorescent probe molecules corroborate these results. The differences in the surface coverage of imide groups strongly correlate with the shear strength of these composites, and both increase with the power and time of the O2 plasma treatment, which is presumably due to greater cumulative exposure to reactive oxygen species. The imide functions that promote adhesion likely form by the oxidation of aniline derivatives present in the T300 composite, and we propose that these functions form covalent bonds with epoxides within the adhesives to improve interfacial chemical bonding. These findings suggest that O2 plasmas increase both mechanical interlocking and interfacial chemical bonding and thus provide greater shear strengths for carbon fiber composites.  © 2021 American Chemical Society.","adhesion; chemical functions; interface; polymer matrix; surface preparation","Adhesion; Adhesives; Aerospace applications; Aniline; Binding energy; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Chemical analysis; Chemical bonds; Electric discharges; Fiber bonding; Fiber reinforced materials; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Morphology; Oxygen; Plasma applications; Shear flow; Surface roughness; Topology; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbon fiber composite; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Fluorescent probe molecules; Interfacial chemicals; Mechanical interlocking; Oxygen plasma treatments; Properties of composites; Surface functional groups; Epoxy resins","D.W.

In this work, we report the control scheme and mechanism of the broadband near-infrared luminescence properties in the tellurium-doped calcium-aluminum-germanate glass. By introducing carbon to construct a reducing atmosphere, the raw material TeO2 is reduced to tellurium element. Through optimizing CaO and Al2O3 content, the configurations and size of topological cages in tellurium doped calcium-aluminum-germanate glass were adjusted to stabilize and tailor tellurium clusters, enabling tunable NIR emission. Furthermore, adjusting the content of TeO2 provides optimal tellurium source to form clusters, and thus enhancing tellurium NIR luminescence. The regulation mechanism of tellurium NIR luminescence performance in the calcium-aluminum-germanate glass is clarified.

In this paper, the authors propose a new approach to be used in the automated machinery mechanism design (the mechanisms are usually subjected to predominant inertial loads) that exploits the capability of the compliant joints to store and release elastic energy in order to reduce the motor torque requirements. Thanks to the carbon-fiber reinforced 3D printing technologies, the compliant joint stiffness can be properly designed to obtain, for the considered mechanism, a resonant condition during its nominal functioning. Moreover, topology optimization can be successfully employed to reduce the mechanism component inertia (keeping the same overall mechanism stiffness) and thus, further diminish the torque requirements. In order to assess the quality of the proposed approach, a pusher mechanism used in a real automated machine has been considered. A prototype has been manufactured to evaluate the effect of the compliant joint introduction and the topology optimization on the motor torque reduction. To validate the results, an experimental campaign has been conducted. Comparison between the standard design approach and the new one emphasizes the superior contribution of compliant joint introduction on the motor torque reduction: a 97% and 96% reduction on the RMS and peak motor torque, respectively, is achieved resorting to the new design approach. Although a high repeatability is achieved, a slight deviation of the trajectory with respect to the ideal one is however registered. © 2022, The Author(s).","Additive manufacturing; Continuous fibre reinforced thermoplastics; Size optimization; Topology optimization","Automation; Compliant mechanisms; Machine design; Mechanisms; Reinforcement; Stiffness; Topology; Torque; Compliant joints; Continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic; Continuous fibers; Design approaches; Fiber reinforced thermoplastics; Motor torque; Size optimization; Systematic design methodologies; Topology optimisation; Torque reduction; 3D printers","G.

Nevertheless, the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector is considered a key contributor to global energy consumption and carbon emissions. The data centers are estimated to consume about 13% of the overall global electricity demand by 2030. Thus, reducing the total carbon emissions of the ICT sector plays a vital factor in achieving the Saudi plan to minimize global carbon emissions. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an eco-friendly approach using a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to reduce the carbon emissions associated with ICT infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. This approach considers the Saudi National Fiber Network (SNFN) as the backbone of Saudi Internet infrastructure. First, we compare two different scenarios of data center locations. The first scenario considers a traditional cloud data center located in Jeddah and Riyadh, whereas the second scenario considers NEOM as a potential cloud data center new location to take advantage of its green energy infrastructure. Then, we calculate the energy consumption and carbon emissions of cloud data centers and their associated energy costs. After that, we optimize the energy efficiency of different cloud data centers locations (in the SNFN) to reduce the associated carbon emissions and energy costs. Simulation results show that the proposed approach can save up to 94% of the carbon emissions and 62% of the energy cost compared to the current cloud physical topology. These savings are achieved due to the shifting of cloud data centers from cities that have conventional energy sources to a city that has rich in renewable energy sources. Finally, we design a heuristic algorithm to verify the proposed approach, and it gives equivalent results to the MILP model. © 2022 Tech Science Press.

It is well known that the current limitation of MOFs in the field of separation is their chemical and thermal stabilities. Therefore, enhancing the structural strength of MOFs via ligand modification (by hydrophobic ligands to prevent moisture attack) or cooperative combination of MOFs with some materials including metal/metal oxide nanoparticles, carbon-based nanomaterials, monoliths, quantum dots, polyoxometalates, silica, and polymers can lead to improve structural stability. For a better understanding of MOFs as sorbents in sample preparation, we summarize their design strategies and synthetic routes followed by a discussion of the introduction of defects in their structures as well as MOF-based composites. The application of MOFs for analytical extraction in various sample pretreatment techniques including solid-phase extraction, dispersive solid-phase extraction, magnetic solid-phase extraction, and solid-phase microextraction with different types of modes (fiber, in-tube, stir, stir-bar, and thin-film) are surveyed.

To address this challenge, we reported a recyclable and degradable epoxy vitrimer with dynamic ester bonds prepared from tung oil and diglycidyl ether of bisphenol-A via epoxy-acid-anhydride crosslinking system. Owing to the compact rigid six-member ring and the anhydride structure, the epoxy vitrimer shows high thermal stability, and excellent dynamic mechanical, and mechanical properties with tensile strength of 59.21 ± 1.02 MPa and glass transition temperature of 76.73 °C. The vitrimer network can achieve topological rearrangement via dynamic transesterification reactions with the addition of a Zn catalyst. Thus, the contrivable vitrimer exhibits excellent self-healing, shape memory, and physical recycling at elevated temperatures. Moreover, the epoxy vitrimer matrix has high joining strength with carbon fibers and can be used to prepare carbon-fiber-reinforced materials (CFRMs). The carbon fibers can be completely recycled from CFRMs through an ethanol-NaOH mixture solvent.

Experiments conducted on three different 2D lattices with hexagonal, chiral and re-entrant topologies of the same relative density (33%) and CF loading (30 wt%) reveal that the CF/PEEK hexagonal lattice (HL), due its relatively brittle response, shows about 40% and 9% decrease in specific energy absorption (SEA) under in-plane and out-of-plane compression, respectively, compared with PEEK HL. While the collapse response of PEEK HL is nearly insensitive to the strain-rate over 43 ≤ ε̇ ≤ 106 s−1, we observe a twenty-fold increase in peak stress and a five-fold increase in SEA under in-plane impact loading over the same range of strain-rates for the CF/PEEK HL. The CF/PEEK lattices exhibit pronounced piezoresistive response under both in-plane and out-of-plane compression with maximum sensitivity of 3.1 and 5.2, respectively, for the re-entrant lattice, offering insight into the damage-state. Higher damage sensitivity indicates faster percolation of new contacts due to folds forming between the cell walls within the lattice under compression. The energy-absorbing and strain- and damage-sensing nature of 3D printed CF/PEEK lattices demonstrated here offers insight into the design of lightweight, high-performance multifunctional lattices. © 2021 The Authors","3D Printing; CF/PEEK cellular composites; Honeycomb lattices; Low-velocity impact; Piezoresistive self-sensing","3D printers; Cellular automata; Cellular manufacturing; Energy absorption; Honeycomb structures; Solvents; Strain rate; Stress analysis; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Carbon fiber/polyetheretherketone cellular composite; Energy; Hexagonal lattice; Honeycomb lattices; Low velocity impact; Piezoresistive self-sensing; Self-sensing; Sensing performance; Carbon fibers","S.

In order to ensure a sufficient component quality, a subsequent visual inspection is necessary, especially in the aerospace industry. The use of automated optical inspection systems can reduce the inspection effort by up to 50 %. Laser line scan sensors, which capture the topology of the surface, are particularly advantageous for this purpose. These sensors project a laser beam at an angle onto the surface and detect its position via a camera. The optical properties of the observed surface potentially have a great influence on the quality of the recorded data. This is especially relevant for dark or highly scattering materials such as Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics (CFRP). For this reason, in this study we investigate the optical reflection and transmission properties of the commonly used Hexel HexPly 8552 IM7 prepreg CFRP in detail. Therefore, we utilise a Gonioreflectometer to investigate such optical characteristics of the material with respect to different fibre orientations, illumination directions and detection angles. In this way, specific scattering information of the material in the hemispherical space are recorded. The major novelty of this research are the findings about the scattering behaviour of the fibre composite material which can be used as a more precise input for the methods of image data quality assessment from our previous research and thus is particularly valuable for developers and users of camera based inspection systems for CFRP components. © 2021, The Author(s).","Automated Fiber Placement; Inline inspection; Laser Line Scan Sensor; Optical material characterisation; Reflection; Transmission","Aerospace industry; Automation; Cameras; Fibers; Laser beams; Light transmission; Optical materials; Optical properties; Automated fiber placement; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Fibre placement; In-line inspections; Laser line scan sensor; Laser lines; Line scan; Materials characterization; Optical material characterization; Prepregs; Inspection","S.

Three models were constructed: (i) a pristine CNT embedded in epoxy resin, (ii) an amino-functionalised CNT embedded in epoxy resin without crosslinking interactions between amino groups and the epoxy resin matrix, and (iii) an amino-functionalised CNT embedded in epoxy resin with crosslinking interactions. The pull-out process was simulated using a steering molecular dynamics simulation to examine the sidewall load transfer effect of the CNTs. The travelling of amino groups along the CNTs was simulated by changing the topology of the functionalised CNT using a polymer consistent force field during the pull-out process. The mean interfacial shear stress, pull-out energy, stress, and atomic displacement were analysed. The results show that the interfacial shear strength as well as the compatibility and cooperativity between the CNTs and the matrix can be efficiently enhanced by introducing amino functional groups. In particular, a dramatic enhancement can be obtained by considering the crosslinking interactions. In addition, the interfacial load transfer between the end of the CNTs and the matrix was studied. The axial normal stress at the end of the CNTs was calculated by placing one diglycidyl ether bisphenol A molecule near the end of the CNT. The results show that there was a large interaction between the end of the CNTs and matrix, which cannot be neglected. Thus, the assumption of zero traction between the fibre end and matrix in the classical shear lag model should be modified at the nanoscale. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Epoxy; Functionalised carbon nanotube; Interface; Molecular dynamics simulation; Stress analysis","Epoxy resins; Interfaces (materials); Loads (forces); Molecular dynamics; Shear stress; Stress analysis; Yarn; Amino group; Dynamics simulation; Enhancement mechanism; Epoxy; Functionalized carbon nanotubes; Load transfer; matrix; Pull-out; Reinforced epoxy; Stresses analysis; Carbon nanotubes","Y.

Owing to this, the functional parts produced by the FDM process of such materials can be used in industrial applications. However, optimal parameters’ selection is crucial to produce parts with optimal properties, such as mechanical strength. This paper focuses on the analysis of influential process parameters on the tensile strength of FDM printed parts. Two statistical methods, RSM and ANN, were applied to investigate the effect the layer thickness, printing speed, raster angle and wall thickness on the tensile strength of test specimens printed with a short carbon fiber reinforced polyamide composite. The reduced cubic model was developed by the RSM method, and the correlation between the input parameters and the output response was analyzed by ANOVA. The results show that the layer thickness and raster angle have the most significant influence on tensile strength. As for machine learning, among the nine different tested ANN topologies, the best configuration was found based on the lowest MAE and MSE test sample result. The results show that the proposed model could be a useful tool for predicting tensile strength. Its main advantage is the reduction in time needed for experiments with the LOSO (leave one subject out) k-fold cross validation scheme, offering better generalization ability, given the small set of learning examples. © 2022 by the authors.

In a preceding process step, a laser-line-triangulation system gathered inline information on a composite part's surface like topology and location of surface contaminants. These data are the basis for an automation of the laser-based surface treatment [J. Weiland, B. Kunze, H. Dittmar, B. Marx, A. Schiebahn, P. Jaeschke, L. Overmeyer, and U. Reisgen, Proc. Inst. Mech. Eng. Part E: J. Process Mech. Eng. 234, 1-10 (2020)]. The gathered data describe the position of bonding areas and surface contaminants and are converted into relative coordinates of the laser's scanning field. During the following laser process, the bonding area is ablated to improve adhesive bonding conditions. The process is monitored online by a broad bandwidth spectrometer covering the range of λ = 200-1100 nm to detect changes in the surface composition. If the spectrometer detects signals related to specific surface contaminants during the laser process, the position of the contamination is logged. In this case, only the areas that showed traces of surface contaminations are laser treated again until the spectrometer stops detecting the contaminant signature. This work presents results of two series of experiments. During the first series of experiments, the spectrometer monitored a UV laser process on a carbon fiber reinforced epoxy. The laser processing was performed on a clean and contaminated surface. An industry standard release agent contaminated the plastic surface. The spectrometer detected differences between the clean and contaminated surface that will be used for an automatic process control. In a second series of experiments, the authors performed a processing parameter analysis in order to identify a potential process window for laser-based surface pretreatment for glass-fiber reinforced polyamide 6. Contact angle analysis, surface roughness measurements, peel strength, and shear strength tests were performed. The results show that an inline controlled laser process is robustly able to pretreat composite surfaces based on spectrometric measurements.  © 2020 Author(s).","","Adhesives; Bonding; Contact angle; Contamination; Fiber bonding; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Graphite fibers; Laser beams; Plastics industry; Pollution detection; Spectrometers; Spectrometry; Surface roughness; Surface treatment; Ultraviolet lasers; Uranium metallography; Vanadium metallography; Automatic process control; Contact angle analysis; Contaminated surfaces; Fiber reinforced composites; Glass fiber reinforced polyamides; Processing parameters; Spectrometric measurements; Surface contaminations; Process control","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85101742710"

It not only covers two atmospheric transmission windows of 35 μm and 813 μm, but also contains strong characteristic vibrational transitions of many important molecules, which makes it quite promising for applications in spectroscopy, materials processing, chemical, and biomolecular sensing, security, and industry. Specifically, the ultrashort pulses, with a time scale of fs to ps, in this band have found direct demands in laser surgery, polymer processing, harmonic generation, strong-field physics, ultrafast imaging, etc, owing to their superior performance. Mode-locking based on temporal coherent superposition, as a robust and compact way of producing ultrashort pulses, has been developed for several decades. In this century, the advanced diode-pumped fiber lasers with a compact and cost-effective design have provided an ideal platform for mode-locked ultrashort pulses generation. Until now, there are many reports on the mode-locked lasers based on the mature silica fiber in the near-infrared region of 12 μm, and some of them have been even developed to commercial products. However, such silica fiber cannot render good service in the mid-infrared, because it will exhibit a significantly increased loss at > 2.2 μm while quenching the mid-infrared transitions of the doped rare-earth ions, due to the high phonon energy of 1100 cm-1. As an alternative, the low-phonon-energy (500600 cm-1) fluoride fiber with the excellent dopant capability, high mechanical strength, and reliable chemical stability has become the most popular mid-infrared medium. Different rare-earth ions (mainly including Er3+, Ho3+, and Dy3+) have also been doped into fluoride fibers to enable mid-infrared laser production at 2.74 μm (Table 1), providing the opportunity for mode-locking formation, hence becoming the hot research topic in the recent decade. Progress: So far, three main mode-locking mechanisms, i.e., material saturable absorption (MSA), nonlinear polarization rotation (NPR), and frequency shifted feedback (FSF) have been exploited in the mid-infrared, among which the MSA mode-locking technique is the pioneer. In 2012, Li et al. used a commercial semiconductor saturable absorber (SESAM) to present a mode-locked Ho3+/Pr3+ co-doped fluoride fiber laser at 2.87 μm, yielding a pulse width of 24 ps, and a repetition rate of 27.1 MHz (Fig. 3). This marks the first mode-locked fluoride fiber laser in the mid-infrared. After that, different saturable absorbers (e.g., InAs, graphene, topological insulator, black phosphorus, carbon nanotube) were introduced into Er3+- and Ho3+-doped fluoride fiber lasers to demonstrate mode-locking in the spectral region of 2.73.5 μm. However, all operated at the ps time scale, limited by the water vapor window and SA performance, where the shortest pulse width measured is 6 ps, reported by Hu et al. using an InAs mode-locked Ho3+/Pr3+ co-doped fluoride fiber ring cavity at 2.86 μm [Fig. 4(a)]. Until 2015, the NPR technique was moved to the mid-infrared, where Duval et al. presented the first NPR soliton mode-locked Er3+-doped fluoride fiber ring oscillator at 2.8 μm, thus pushing the pulse width towards the fs scale (i.e., 207 fs), for the first time (Fig. 7). After that, a multitude of efforts have made on improving the mode-locking performances, e.g., pulse narrowing, power/energy scaling, wavelength extension. One of the impressive results is that completed by Huang et al., where the recorded sub-two-cycle pulse width of 15.9 fs with a peak power of 500 kW were produced through the external amplification and nonlinear compression seeded by a dispersion-management NPR mode-locked Er3+-doped fluoride fiber ring oscillator at 2.8 μm [Fig. 8(a)]. Recently, the wavelength of fs soliton pulses was extended to the 3.5 μm band using a NPR mode-locked dual-wavelength pumped Er3+-doped fluoride fiber ring cavity [Fig. 8(c)]. In 2018, Woodward et al. firstly introduced the FSF mechanism by an acousto-optic tunable filter (AOTF) into a Dy3+-doped ZBLAN fiber laser. The achieved ps mode-locked pulse could be tuned from 2.97 to 3.30 μm (Fig. 10), representing the current broadest level of mode-locked fiber lasers at any wavelengths. Subsequently, the compact AOTF was also applied in Er3+- and Ho3+-doped fluoride fiber lasers to enable tunable ps pulses in the sub-region of 2.73.6 μm. To circumvent the issue of bandwidth limitation from either AOTF or water vapor windows, Majewski et al. used an acousto-optic modulator (AOM) instead to establish an FSF mode-locked Dy3+-doped fluoride fiber laser at the wavelength of beyond 3 μm. The soliton operation with an estimated pulse width of 825 fs was obtained. Conclusions and Prospects: The past decade has seen great progress of mid-infrared mode-locked fluoride fiber lasers, enabling a range of new applications. Different mechanisms, e.g., MSA, NPR, and FSF, have been introduced into rare-earth ions doped fluoride fiber lasers to demonstrate mode-locked operations in the spectral region of 2.73.6 μm and with the time scale of 10 s of fs to ps. However, most of these systems involve some local free-space alignments, weakening the stability, reliability and compactness while preventing pulse narrowing and soliton formation especially at the strong water vapor absorption band. Thus the development towards a robust all-fiber structure is undoubtedly the trend in the future. In addition, the performance parameters of the mode-locked fiber lasers in the mid-infrared fall far short of that in the near-infrared, which needs to be improved by employing new mode-locking techniques and designs. Parallel to the mid-infrared continuous wave fluoride fiber lasers, further extending the wavelength of mode-locked pulses is also an important direction. © 2022, Chinese Lasers Press.

Different from the filament winding or fused deposition modeling process in additive manufacture, large-scale formwork is fabricated with layered winding of FRP fabric and simultaneously applying fast cure epoxy resin in the proposed methods. It increases the fabrication speed and material efficiency compared with the typical fabrication process of FRP formworks, and achieved the geometry flexibility from the numerically controlled additive process. The fabrication methods are developed through a series of preliminary tests, exploring the appropriate fabrication parameters, such as the overlapping height of each layer, winding speed, and epoxy resin type. Two additional prototypes addressing geometrical flexibility are also fabricated. Based on the feasibility studies, the article discussed the potential application of this system on a double-skin tubular arch (DSTA) bridge and a tree-like topological optimized column as the future outlook of this method. As developed based on the established construction systems such as CFFTs and DSTAs, not only the proposed system is compatible with current structure and construction system, but it also benefits from combining an off-shelf material with a flexible and accurate programmable robotic process.

In the proposed approach, the density-based topology optimization was integrated with the multi-stage genetic algorithm (GA) to optimize the repeatable unit cell of the core structure of sandwich sheets. Two optimization schemes were adopted, in which one optimizes the formability and the other one optimizes the bending stiffness while fulfilling potential failure constraints. The failure constraints on core shear failure and face buckling were theoretically deduced to mathematically formulate the topology optimization problem, which was solved by the adaptive multi-stage GA to increase the possibility of generating physically meaningful and additively manufacturable topologies. For the experimental evaluations of mechanical properties and formability, the final optimal topologies under volume fraction constraints of 50% and 62.5% were additively manufactured using carbon fibre reinforced nylon. Comparing the sandwich topologies obtained by two optimization schemes, the bending stiffness of sandwich topologies with the core density of 50% and 62.5% are improved by 41.58% and 41.49%, while the energy absorption capabilities are improved by 13.60% and 29.40% respectively. L-bending and draw-bending tests indicate the improved formability of topologically optimized sandwich sheets. The proposed approach is capable of designing formable sandwich sheets with improved bending stiffness, which is expected to expand the application envelope of sandwich sheets with better mechanical properties. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Additive manufacturing; Bending stiffness; Carbon fibre reinforced thermoplastics; Forming; Topology optimization","3D printers; Additives; Bending tests; Carbon fibers; Formability; Genetic algorithms; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Thermoplastics; Topology; Bending stiffness; Carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic; CFRP-core; Density-based; Mechanical; Multi-stages; Optimization scheme; Property; Sandwich sheets; Topology optimisation; Stiffness","J.

First, the formulation of a multi-material topology optimization problem is described in which anisotropic materials with different OAs are considered as different materials. Then, linear elasticity topological derivatives are calculated when an anisotropic material is replaced with a different anisotropic material. Subsequently, we outline a topology optimization method based on the extended level set method, which is used to solve the multi-material topology optimization problem.

Additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing of CFRP composites has added a new dimension to the existing research of CFRP composites. However, one of the caveats of 3D printed CFRP composites is that the dimensional accuracy and the surface finish achieved fail to meet the standard tolerance requirement. To achieve the desired accuracy further post-process machining is required. However, machining an anisotropic material such as 3D printed CFRP composites impose challenges. This study aims at investigating the machining behavior and post-processing capability of 3D printed CFRP using numerical modeling and simulation using ABAQUS/Explicit, a commercially available powerful finite element analysis (FEA) software package. Influence of machining parameters, such as feed and depth of cut (DOC) and 3D printing parameter, such as percentage of overlap between adjacent passes have been studied. The post-processing capability or machining behavior of 3D printed CFRP has been evaluated by dependent parameters, such as, cutting forces, strain, chip and burr formation, and the resultant surface topology. With the use of proper damage parameters, such as, ductile and shear damage and Johnson-Cook criterion for plasticity, a 3D model was developed in the FEA. Eight layers were stacked with the orientation of 45°-135°-45°-135°. The layers were joined using cohesive properties. Damage in the cohesive bonds was also defined using the quadratic damage criterion to model delamination. To capture the changes in elemental level, linear tetrahedral elements C3D4T, were used. A reference point on the bottom layer was used to capture the history of cutting forces. The cutting and thrust forces increased with the increase of DOC and feed. The rigidity, shape of the flutes and print direction influenced chip formation. Finally, the proposed model was used to observe the quality of surface finish. © 2022","CFRP composite; milling; Numerical modeling; post-processing; simulation","3D modeling; 3D printers; ABAQUS; Cutting; Finishing; Industrial research; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite; Cutting forces; Machining behaviors; Model and simulation; Post-processing; Processing capability; Simulation; Surface finishes; Numerical models","M.P.

The investigations were conducted at laboratory level, utilizing two 3D printing technologies to acquire the desired cellular structures which were further tested for tensile, bending and impact resistance. The first selected technology was Fused Deposition Modelling with Continuous Filament Fabrication to obtain 3D printed parts, which can be reinforced with continuous carbon, glass, or Kevlar fibers. The second technology used is Digital Light Processing 3D printing, which uses photopolymer liquid resin that cures under digital light source. The main motivation of utilizing the 3D printing technologies is the desire of implementing rapid prototyping in the final manufacturing of the turbine system components with structural topological optimization and improved structural and dynamic efficiency through biomimetic inspired structures. Conventional polymeric composite manufacturing technologies are sometimes restrictive in the geometries they can produce, and there is a chance that additive manufacturing can step in and help create internal structures that could not be obtained through conventional manufacturing methods. New developed structural architectures could be manufactured for a specific application through 3D printing which allows for a high level of customization parameters, including the possibility to use continuous carbon, glass and Kevlar fiber to create the geometrical pattern. All these, combined with conventional composite manufacturing technologies, could lead to obtain better end results. © 2022, ModTech Publishing House.

This is achieved by extending an existing RVE generation strategy in two significant ways: (1) the local cross section shape of the tow is adjusted depending on the local tow curvature in a way that preserves the cross sectional area of the tow, and (2) the elementary crimp interval is separated into a planar and a transition region. The modifications facilitate the generation of a wide range of elaborate textile topologies without tow intersections, which are present without the proposed modifications unless complex tow to tow contact models are introduced. The mechanical properties of plain weaves were predicted based on the topology generated with the proposed algorithm as well as based on RVEs which were constructed based on actual micrographs, i.e. a “digital twin” of the actual microstructure. A comparison of the predicted mechanical properties based on finite element and Multiscale Generalized Method of Cells techniques shows close agreement. However, some differences exist with respect to experimentally determined material parameters due to the finite dimensions of the specimens. Lastly, mechanical properties of multilayered weaves are predicted with the finite element method. The considered material systems are carbon fiber in epoxy matrix as well as C/C-SiC. However, the procedure is applicable to a wide range of material systems. © 2019","Composites; Multiscale analysis; RVE generation","Carbon fibers; Composite materials; Curve fitting; Fiber reinforced plastics; Finite element method; Mechanical properties; Topology; Cross section shape; Cross sectional area; Fiber reinforced composites; Generalized method of cells; Multi scale analysis; Representative volume element (RVE); RVE generation; Transition regions; Weaving","D.

The vast majority of additive manufacturing processes create monolithic components, meaning material can be deposited to create freeform shapes of varying thickness and of a generally continuous material phase (or phases in multi-material systems). Many engineered components and materials, however, gain strength and functionality through strategic placement of distinct, discrete objects, such as reinforcing fibers. Often these objects come in fixed size and shape, and are not permitted to overlap due to physical contact or functional requirements. Recent technological advances have brought this concept to additive manufacturing, with techniques such as pick-and-place and deposition of reinforcing fibers making their way into 3D printing hardware. To fully leverage these tremendous capabilities, engineers must rethink the way they approach component design. Topology optimization can enhance this process and offer a systematic approach to exploring the now expanded design space afforded by these new technologies. Classical topology optimization approaches, however, are not capable of designing structures composed of discrete objects. Herein an approach based on Discrete Object Projection (DOP) is presented for simultaneously optimizing component topology and the distribution of discrete reinforcing objects within the topology. Specifically we are motivated by recent using reinforcing yarns, where a 3D printer may deposit either a polymer material or a carbon nanotube yarn encased in polymer at a given location. As in typical projection-based approaches, all geometric constraints, including length scales of the objects, spacing between the objects, and length scales of the component are achieved through the projection functions without additional constraints. The proposed algorithm is used to simultaneously design the structural component topology and the reinforcement within this topology.

With the great development of new research on materials and applications, using Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP) instead of aluminum alloys to fabricate the display console frame structure has become an international hot point. However, whether the components obtained by CFRP can meet the requirements of complex working conditions, and whether the structural design is reasonable, are still existing problems. This study analyzed the stress distribution of the bottom frame structure of CFRP display console under impact and vibration conditions. The frame structure was optimized based on the stress distribution and topology. The results show that the maximum stress value of the frame structure under complex conditions was 16.97MPa, the maximum stress after optimization was 22.94MPa. The reduction of weight of this complex structure was 13%. The prototypes have passed the actual working condition test. This study shows that the route method based on impact stress to optimize the wall thickness of CFRP structures is feasible and effective. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","","Aluminum alloys; Command and control systems; Fiber reinforced materials; Glass ceramics; Military applications; Reinforcement; Stress concentration; Structural design; Structural frames; Vibration analysis; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; CFRP structures; Complex condition; Complex structure; Existing problems; Frame structure; Optimization design; Vibration condition; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","Y.Z.

The compression moulding manufacturing process and CAE optimisation are unique and ground-breaking for this product and are designed to allow high volume manufacture of approx. 30,000 vehicles per year. The manufacturing techniques employed allow for multi-material construction within a five minute cycle time to make the process viable for volume manufacture. The complexities of the design lie in the areas of manufacturing, CAE prediction and highly specialised design methods. It is a well-known fact that the performance of a composite part is primarily determined by the way it is manufactured. The design team were able to use their extensive knowledge of material behaviour and state of the art manufacturing cells to enable a component that meets the required functional requirements. The CAE optimisation techniques developed during the project made a significant contribution to the project by bypassing a traditional approach and also reducing the amount of physical testing required. This was required to understand the failure mechanisms of the sheer number of combinations of fibre orientations that make the predictive analysis methods viable for a topology efficient design. A compression moulding manufacturing technology was developed capable of mass manufacturing the high strength, stiff and complex shaped suspension knuckle. The processing technology is fully automated, achieving a cycle time below 5 minutes. © 2019 Ford Motor Company.

And the carbon fiber composite curved honeycombs (CCCHs) are manufactured via a molding and bonding process. The out-of-plane compressive properties of the woven and unidirectional laminated CCCHs are measured and analyzed. In addition, the effects of curvature radius and wall thickness on the compressive strength of the laminated CCCHs are investigated. The experimental results show that the out-of-plane compressive strengths increase when only the curvature radius decreases or the wall thickness increases. By comparison, the out-of-plane compressive strengths of the laminated CCCHs show superior to those of almost existing competitive lightweight honeycombs, and it can be considered as a selective lightweight sandwich structure.

A gradient-based discrete material and thickness optimization (DMTO) algorithm was developed by using casting-based explicit parameterization to suppress the intermediate void across the thickness of the laminate. A benchmark problem was first studied to compare the DMTO approach with the sequential three-phase design method using the free size, ply thickness, and stacking sequence of the laminates. Following this, the DMTO approach was applied to a practical design problem featuring a CFRP-laminated engine hood by minimizing overall compliance subject to volume-related and functional constraints under multiple load cases. To verify the optimized design, a prototype of the CFRP engine hood was created for experimental tests. The results showed that the simultaneous discrete topology optimization of ply orientation and thickness was an effective approach for the design of CFRP-laminated structures. © 2019 by ASME.","carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP); discrete material and thickness optimization (DMTO); lightweight; manufacturing constraints; topology optimization","Engines; Laminating; Shape optimization; Topology; Carbon fiber reinforced plastic; Carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; Discrete material and thickness optimization; Discrete material optimizations; Discrete topology; Lightweight; Manufacturing constraint; Ply thickness; Thickness optimization; Topology optimisation; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","Y.

Conventional approaches to fabricate suitable scaffolds with enhanced electrical conductivity require multiple steps including the surface coating of conductive polymers or the encapsulation of conductive fillers. In this work, a new type of three-dimensional porous carbon fiber sponge-based electrical conductive scaffold with a fiber diameter of 8.1 (±2.1) μm was fabricated by one-step high-temperature carbonization at 800 °C from an abundantly available biomaterial - cotton. The as-carbonized cotton has a suitable pore size from several dozens to hundreds of micrometers, low toxicity, and good biocompatibility. Its hydrophilicity and biocompatibility were further modified by surface oxidation and polydopamine coating. The topological feature, surface functional groups, hydrophilicity, and electrical conductivity of the carbonized cotton were studied. The as-carbonized, oxidized, and polydopamine-coated scaffolds have electrical conductivities of 32.6, 44.9 and 128.2 S/m, respectively. The cytocompatibility and the effect of electrical stimulation on cell behavior were evaluated by cell culture with and without electrical stimulation. It was observed that the polydopamine coating significantly improved the hydrophilicity and cytocompatibility.

A dual trend is the increasing use of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) for aircraft structures, due to the superior mechanical properties of CFRP compared to metallic structures. However, the poorer electrical conductivity of CFRP results in the aircraft structure no longer being fully integrated with the electrical power system. There is a need to integrate these two systems to fully maximize the performance benefits of CFRP, and optimize the weight and volume of the electrical power system. A first step in this integration is to identify an appropriate fault management strategy, which enables the detection of higher resistance ground faults through CFRP. This includes the consideration of appropriate grounding topologies. This paper proposes the implementation of a high resistance grounding topology, which enables the detection and location of a fault via spectral analysis of the voltage across the grounding resistor. From this, implications for wider EPS and CFRP designs to enable the reduction in the use of bulky cable harnesses, providing the first step to CFRP becoming an integral part of the EPS, are discussed. © 2019 AIAA.","","Aircraft manufacture; Airframes; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Carbon fibers; Electric grounding; Electric power systems; Fault detection; Spectrum analysis; Topology; Voltage measurement; Aircraft applications; Carbon fibre reinforced polymer; Decentralized architecture; Electrical conductivity; Electrical power system; High resistance grounding; Metallic structures; Performance benefits; More electric aircraft","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85078141271"

SnIP, the first atomic-scale double helical semiconductor combines structural anisotropy and robustness with exceptional electronic properties. The benefit of the double helix, combined with a diverse structure on the nanoscale, ranging from strong covalent bonding to weak van der Waals interactions, and the large structure and property anisotropy offer substantial potential for applications in energy conversion and water splitting. It represents the next logical step in downscaling the inorganic semiconductors from classical 3D systems, via 2D semiconductors like MXenes or transition metal dichalcogenides, to the first downsizeable, polymer-like atomic-scale 1D semiconductor SnIP. SnIP shows intriguing mechanical properties featuring a bulk modulus three times lower than any IV, III-V, or II-VI semiconductor. In situ bending tests substantiate that pure SnIP fibers can be bent without an effect on their bonding properties. Organic and inorganic hybrids are prepared illustrating that SnIP is a candidate to fabricate flexible 1D composites for energy conversion and water splitting applications.

Pseudo-woven laminates make use of an automated fiber placement (AFP) manufacturing process to produce a unique laminate architecture. These laminates are heterogeneous with spatially defined features where elasticity tensor is spatially variable unlike traditional composites. The heterogeneity is associated with interply locking and topological variations in the fiber orientations within individual layers resulting in multiple interfaces and an expanded design space. In this study, carbon/epoxy pseudo-woven subassemblies are hybridized with traditional unidirectional layups to enhance impact and damage tolerance. Three different laminate configurations are assessed under high velocity impact according to ASTM D8101. During the experiments digital image correlation (DIC) and high-speed video were employed to evaluate the laminate's response. Preliminary results on 24 ply laminates indicate pseudo-woven architecture exhibits increased penetration resistance and reduced back face surface damage compared to traditional laminates. © 2020 Soc. for the Advancement of Material and Process Engineering.

In comparison with other SAs, GO reveals various advantages including relative widely operation bandwidth, easy fabrication, low saturation intensity, ultrashort recovery time. For specific application, the wavelength tuning of PML-FL is required but is limited for the SESAM or CN.

Among the most crucial requirements in the new generation of aerospace, vehicles are optimizing their structural material stiffness, strength, and fuel-to-weight ratio. Accordingly, it has been established that lightweight polymer-based composite materials represent the ideal alternative to relatively heavy metallic structural alloys. Graphene/epoxy nanocomposites have been attracted much attention due to their exceptional mechanical properties. They have been used in fabricating carbon fiber/graphene/epoxy hybrid composites for improved properties relative to traditional carbon fiber/epoxy composites. This work addresses the interfacial interaction and adhesion in graphene/epoxy nanocomposite materials. This is necessary to investigate and maintain the material integrity at the nanoscale level by tailoring the molecular network structure. Molecular dynamics simulation with a reactive force field was used to quantify the interfacial interaction energy of the nanocomposite constituents, and graphene pull-out simulations were used to determine the interfacial shear strength. It has been shown that surface functionalization of graphene nanoplatelets can significantly increase their interfacial adhesion with the hosting epoxy matrix. The results show that there is a tremendous improvement in the functionalized graphene/epoxy interfacial interaction energy up to ~570%. Furthermore, surface functionalization of graphene nanoplatelets can improve the interfacial shear strength by ~750 times. This substantial improvement is from altering the noncovalent graphene-epoxy interfacial adhesion into strong covalent bonding utilizing the functional groups. Furthermore, the wrinkled and rough topology of functionalized graphene is found to improve the interlocking mechanism with the host matrix. These findings are important to the future of synthesizing next generation ultra-strength and lightweight polymer-based nanocomposite materials. © ASCE.","","Adhesion; Aerospace industry; Composite materials; Composite structures; Earth (planet); Graphene; Graphene Nanoplatelets; Graphite fibers; Heavy metal alloys; Molecular dynamics; Nanocomposites; Shear flow; Carbon fiber/epoxy composites; Functionalized graphene; Interfacial interaction; Interfacial shear strength; Interlocking mechanisms; Molecular dynamics modeling; Molecular dynamics simulations; Surface Functionalization; Strength of materials","G.M.

The homogenization by asymptotic expansion is used to find the effective properties and a topology optimization procedure is conducted to find the optimal material distribution. In the adopted Representative Volume Element (RVE), the fibers are fixed in the domain, and the optimization is performed only at matrix, whose properties are parameterized by the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method. Three distinct linear combinations of the components of the fourth order stiffness tensor are chosen, as well as three distinct admissible volume fractions for the matrix. Qualitative results, showing the topologies of the RVEs, and numerical results are presented. The qualitative results are shown by both the optimal material distributions in the RVEs and the convergence plots of the objective functions. The numerical results are highlighted by both the optimal numerical solutions and the full fourth order elasticity tensor. The results show which regions of the RVE play a significant role for the effective properties of the composite and may be used for a careful manufacturing process guide. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

Sandwich structures consist in a thick core material as honeycomb bonded with thin skins as carbon fibres. When the core material contains closed cells, water ingression must be considered. This water ingression may significantly increase the weight of the core and can induce damage. In this project, new spoiler design is proposed based on reinforced stiffeners in order to avoid the use of honeycomb. In a first step model is built and validated on current spoiler. Then, topology tool is used to locate the stiffeners. Finally, GFEM is performed to propose a first rough plies optimization under static analysis. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This is the reason for the rapid increase over the last few years in the replacement of conventional alloys (i.e., steel and cast iron) with low-density materials (i.e., aluminum alloys, composites) and in the redesign of components shape in order to remove the unnecessary material (e.g., related to the introduction of additive manufacturing or high-strength materials). Despite this general trend, the use of higher-density metals and massive geometries is still predominant in the production of structural components, especially for heavy vehicles and safety-relevant parts. Aim of the present review is to summarize how this current situation can be overcome. The analysis started with an investigation about the materials that can be used for the production of structural parts, the potential reduction of the component weight and its costs. The scenarios analyzed foreseen by 2030 an improved weight reduction combined with additional cost. Both the parameters increased when moving from medium/small vehicles to luxury vehicles (from -18% to -35% weight and from €3 to €8-10 per kg saved, respectively) as a direct consequence of an increased usage of lighter materials. Then, the research reports some relevant actual applications, which succeeded in the weight reduction of these kind of components.

The main reason lies in the limitation of printing path design, which cannot guarantee to print carbon fibres along load transmission paths of composite parts. Here we address this issue by proposing an ingenious path-designed 3D (PD-3D) printing approach that considers the load transmission path and anisotropic property of the continuous carbon fibre reinforced filament. Complex structures of carbon fibre reinforced composites, with enhanced lightweight, were demonstrated. Such structures of carbon fibres paving along load transmission paths, greatly reduce stress concentration and achieve a quasi-isotropic performance. By comparing printed specimens with drilled holes and semicircles, the PD-3D printed specimens with holes and semicircles are 67.5% and 62.4% higher in tensile and flexural strength, respectively.

To achieve this mining capability, sandwich composites offer an optimum structure for space mining vehicles due to their relatively high strength and stiffness compared to their weight. The challenge of designing such structures is often hampered by the lack of design approaches for practicing engineers in the mining industry usually lacking the composite material expertise or access to significant test capabilities. Expanding the use of sandwich composite materials into this industry requires selection charts that fully define the material system for a design engineer. Currently there is no methodology that systematically allows a design engineer to define a material system that uses carbon fiber reinforced plastics with aluminum honeycomb cores. The purpose of this paper is to introduce novel selection charts that allow an engineer to define the number of plies, stacking sequence, core thickness, and core density of a sandwich composite based off the moment carrying capacity. An example implementation of this approach is conducted using a carbon-fiber/epoxy with an aluminum alloy 5052 core. The selection charts developed with this approach are than validated with experimental analysis in accordance with ASTM D7249 (Standard Test Method for Facing Properties of Sandwich Construction by Long Beam Flexure). Experimental results show strong correlation with the selection charts by predicting the available moment and the mode of failure. Such selection charts will help facilitate wider use of these materials into industries that do not currently use them. Additionally, a novel numerical modeling approach for thick section sandwich composites using 3D finite elements is introduced. This approach shows how sandwich composites can be modeled with standard 3D elements instead of elements that support layers. Such an approach reduces solutions times by minimizing the number of integration points that are inherent when using layered elements. This approach is conducive to rapid design iterations when topological changes are occurring such as in a research and development environment. Numerical results are compared with analytical solutions with good correlation. © 2020 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

So as to harmonize all of those objectives to an optimal compromise, topology optimization has been used in tandem with consultations of design and structural experts. Additionally, an aerospace part, namely a 3D printed titanium insert was built and glued into an aluminium sandwich panel with carbon fiber reinforced plastic face sheets. This composite panel was then subjected to actual flight loads of the METimage satellite campaign. During all mechanical and thermal tests, cracks are captured via acoustic monitoring.

Take-off gross weight can be divided into crew weight, payload, fuel, and empty weight. The empty weight is divided into the structure, engine/s, landing gear, avionics and fixed equipment. Engine/s, landing gear, avionics and fixed equipment are selective items. Weight optimization can be made for structure and landing gear to minimize aircraft total weight. The main objective of the present study is to optimize weight and reach safe landing for a medium range UAV landing gear. The reduced weight can be used to increase payload and/or fuel to increase range or endurance of the UAV. In the present study, ANSYS shape (Topology) optimization tool is used to get a proposed shape for the UAV landing gear. Then parametric size optimization of the shape proposed was done. Design of experiment (DOE) technique is used in order to get the minimum weight for the landing gear at a specified stress limit. Aluminum alloy 7075-T61 and bi-directional carbon fiber which are the most common used materials in UAVs landing gear were used, It was found that using topology weight optimization technique reduces Aluminum Alloy landing gear weight by (30.4 %) changing the material to be bi-directional carbon fiber without optimization reduce landing gear weight with additional value (27.9 %). Optimizing bi-directional carbon fiber landing gear reduces the weight with additional value (4 %) to be the total weight ratio by (62.3 %).

The main design challenge of high-speed PM machines comes from the PM rotor design due to the low strength and high thermal sensitivity of PM materials. In this paper, the mechanical constraints and speed limits for a high-speed rotor topology are derived with analytical equations. Thereafter, a case study is done to design an 80 kW, 80 000 r/min PM machine. Analysis results show that the high rotor eddy-current loss is one of the key factors contributing to the overheat of the PMs. Hence, a hybrid sleeve topology, which contains an inner titanium cylinder and an outer cylinder made up of carbon fiber composite, is proposed to suppress the rotor eddy-current losses. The optimal dimensions of the hybrid sleeve are obtained by finite element analysis. Thereafter, a comparison among the proposed and two other sleeve topologies, namely, the copper clad sleeve and grooved sleeve, is done from the point of view of their rotor eddy-current losses, rotor temperature rise, mechanical stress, and critical speed. The results indicate that the hybrid sleeve gains an advantage over the other two topologies. For the designed case, the rotor eddy-current losses and temperature rise are decreased by 66.4% and 73 °C, respectively, by using the hybrid sleeve. Furthermore, a reduction of 14.5% for the rotor maximum stress is obtained with the hybrid sleeve, while the rotor's first critical speed has little reduction. © 1972-2012 IEEE.","Eddy-current loss; high-speed; hybrid sleeve; permanent-magnet (PM) machine; rotor design; speed limit","Carbon fibers; Cylinders (shapes); Eddy current testing; Rotors; Solids; Speed; Tensile stress; Topology; Eddy current-loss; Force; High Speed; hybrid sleeve; Permanent-magnet machine; Rotor design; Shafts; Speed limit; Permanent magnets","D.

In part, this is due to the application of design approaches that were originally meant for metallic constructions. As a result, advanced composite structures end up having a redundant layup, with a quasi-isotropic stacking sequence that eliminates anisotropy, instead of leveraging it, so called black aluminum. Today's approach to take better advantage of continuous carbon fiber's mechanical properties, fibers are aligned based on the anticipated loading conditions. This can be achieved using hand layup or automated tape layup (ATL) / automated fiber placement (AFP) techniques. Though this provides a significant improvement over the ""black aluminum""approach, it still falls short of realizing the full potential of continuous fiber anisotropy. Since carbon fibers perform best in tension, the part itself should be redesigned to take advantage of this effect. Though this exercise may seem intuitive for simple parts, in the aerospace industry these coupled design activities easily become non-intuitive due to the complex loading conditions the aircraft structures are subjected to. Arris Composites has developed a new process, additive molding™, capable of manufacturing complex geometries, using continuous fiber. This paper presents optimizing topology and fiber orientation for an aerospace bracket, having complex 3D load cases. These optimized structures are shown to outperform current composite structures as well as structures machined and 3D printed from metal, making them ideal for next generation aerospace brackets and joining structures.  © 2020.

In its early form, the leaf-spring was manufactured using metals like steel, but, in modern applications, there exist composite leaves reinforced by advance glass and carbon fibers. Benefits of composite spring designs include: high specific strength, ability to form complex profiles, and possibility of subcomponent consolidation to reduce assembly. Due to the bending characteristics of the leaf spring, the axial load decreases through the beam thickness, reaching a minimum at the neutral surface. Given this fact, a design optimization approach for mono-composite leaf springs is developed considering a hybrid fiber-layup. Initially, a detailed topology optimization is conducted to optimize the geometry of the leaf spring based on the Tsai-Wu failure model. This process yielded a unique spring design which reduced the mass of the spring by 29% compared to the initial non-optimized spring and 80–90% compared to a steel spring. Subsequently, the design is further optimized by replacing low stress, high modulus reinforcement with lower modulus and cost-effective materials to improve overall vehicle mass, efficiency, and operation. The second stage of the optimization based on the hybrid fiber-layup approach resulted in an additional 7% mass reduction. As there is a connection between fuel efficiency and vehicle mass, the significant reduction of spring mass has a positive impact on vehicle fuel consumption and leads to suspension responsiveness gains. Moreover, the possibility of swapping up to 20% of the middle plies reinforcement with commodity plastics demonstrates the cost benefits of the hybrid fiber-layup design approach considering the high cost of carbon and other high-performance reinforcements. © 2019, Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.","Composite leaf springs; Hybrid fiber-layup; Multi-material design; Shape optimization","Automobile manufacture; Cost effectiveness; Efficiency; Fuels; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Shape optimization; Steel fibers; Topology; Vehicles; Bending characteristics; Design optimization; Glass and carbon fibers; High specific strength; High-performance reinforcements; Hybrid fiber; Modern applications; Multi-material designs; Leaf springs","S.

The nonporous random (NPR-PCL) and porous random (PR-PCL) and the nonporous-aligned (NPA-PCL) and porous-aligned (PA-PCL) fibrous PCL meshes were directly spun on flat or rotary collectors from 18% PCL solutions using ethyl acetate/acetone or ethyl acetate/dimethyl sulfoxide, respectively. The morphology and type of CaCO3 crystal grown on PCL fiber scaffolds were analyzed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), contact angle measurements, scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), focused ion beam combined with scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD) techniques. The PCL fibers distributions affected the nucleation and stabilized calcite and vaterite polymorphs of CaCO3 with different crystal population densities. The crystal density of vaterite was higher than calcite (2:1) when the NPA-PCL and PA-PCL fibers were used as a template, but calcite predominated (2:1) on P-PCL fiber mesh with respect to the NP-PCL fiber mesh. We found that CaCO3 crystals covered the surface of PCL fibers, and some of them grown from inside of the PCL fibers showed that PCL fibers were occluded inside the CaCO3 crystals during the GD crystallization. The nano- and microscale topological features of PCL scaffolds control the diffusion of carbon dioxide (CO2) gas through PCL fiber meshes in the soaking of PCL meshes into a calcium chloride (CaCl2) solution during the GD crystallization affecting subsequently the nucleation and growth of CaCO3 crystals. Indeed, pore size feature of the micrometric A-PCL and nanometric R-PCL fiber meshes affected the intensities of the crystallographic faces of calcite and vaterite as observed by XRD. Contact angle measurements of the aqueous and crystallization liquid droplet on NPR-PCL, PR-PCL and A-PCL fibrous showed different hydrophobic character of the PCL meshes. This study shows the role of the nano- and microscale topological features and the presence of pores on PCL fiber scaffolds on the mineralization behavior of CaCO3 deposited on R-PCL and A-PCL fiber scaffolds, and by this approach various aspects of controlled CaCO3 crystallization such as nucleation and crystal growth of biomaterials based on CaCO3 can be studied with potential biotech applications.

The rotor described in this paper pushes the tip speed to about 80% of the speed of sound. An outer rotor design with a carbon-fiber retaining ring on the outer diameter (OD) was chosen to maintain high magnetic loading in the airgap while ensuring structural integrity at high speed. To achieve manufactural feasibility, a cantilevered rotor structure was proposed to suspend the rotor around the stator. This architecture introduces significant rotordynamic challenges, one of which is the 'trunnion effect, ' a rotordynamic effect uncommon in traditional electric machines. This effect was identified when a discrepancy was observed during a rotor test and a root-cause analysis was performed to explain it. The original rotor dynamic model was modified to include this effect, and verified through a ping test. The trunnion effect, which significantly reduces the critical speeds, can be offset by selecting appropriate dimensions for the rotor end plate using the revised model. Thus, even in the presence of this effect, the proposed unconventional motor topology is confirmed to function reliably. © 2020 IEEE.","Permanent magnet motor; Rotating machine mechanical factors; Testing","Graphite fibers; Permanent magnets; Speed; Synchronous motors; Cantilevered rotor; Electrical loading; Magnetic loading; Outer diameters; Permanent Magnet Synchronous Motor; Retaining ring; Revised modeling; Root cause analysis; Rotors (windings)","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85098668841"

Specifically, we investigate the drone structure at both macroscopic and microscopic scales, by making use of finite element and atomistic simulations, respectively. The structural analysis is performed with the aim to equip the drone with specific sensors and measuring instruments capable to detect the existence of volcanic ash, SO2, CO2 and other pollutants in the atmosphere after a vulcanic eruption. We show that, by modeling the tubular structure of the drone with a sandwich constituted by a a polystyrene core, carbon fiber skins and epoxy matrix, a weight saving of 7 grams for each drone arm can be obtained, in comparison to the standard commercial drones, although a slight worsening of the mechanical performances is observed. In addition, the molecular structure of the polystyrene chains has been investigated by using atomistic Molecular Dynamics simulations, providing further information on the local structure of the polymer chains. Additional improvements of the weight saving could be obtained by means of the the topological optimization techniques on the body of the drone and on the supports for landing.  © 2021 by the author(s).","","","G.

The analyzed specimen consists of two unidirectional carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRP) face sheets and a 3D-printed polymeric core. Low velocity impact tests are conducted first to characterize the unit cell deformation pattern, and we further explore its influence on core structure behavior as well as sandwich panel performance. It is found that the re-entrant topology exhibits lower energy absorption capacity but superior robustness and durability. Consequently, the re-entrant panel performs best in both force mitigation and energy dissipation, provided that the impact energy is appropriate. Furthermore, employing re-entrant core not only stabilizes the occurrences of the face sheet penetration as the impact energy increases, but also grants the sandwich panel consistent behaviors under multi-cycle impacts. These unique performances are due to the global instability of the auxetic structure, which yields more compliant deformation and less stress concentration. Resultant discrepancies shall be interpreted with the sandwich core deformation for validation. These findings pave the way for developing new class of auxetic lattice composites, especially under cyclic loading conditions, through a combination of rational design and 3D printing. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd.","Auxetic; Durability; Lattice; Low velocity impact; Reliability; Robustness","Deformation; Durability; Energy dissipation; Fiber reinforced plastics; Honeycomb structures; Reliability; Robustness (control systems); Sandwich structures; Structural design; Auxetic; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Comparative studies; Cyclic loading conditions; Lattice; Low velocity impact; Low velocity impact test; Sandwich composites; 3D printers","S.

Through comparative analyses, the advantages and disadvantages of every topological design are presented, and the guidelines of design optimization are summarized.

Recently, formaldehyde stabilization during lignin extraction and biomass pretreatment has been found to drastically enhance subsequent lignin upgradeability but can affect cellulose digestibility. The exact role and/or form of formaldehyde on the residual biomass surface is still not fully understood. Here, we use magic angle spinning (MAS) dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) methods to characterize the components that remain inside the residual cell wall after the lignin extraction process and reveal the topochemistry of the solid residue. The regioselectivity of relayed DNP allows the observation of hyperpolarization in a range of 40-200 nm from the surface of the cell wall for poplar wood materials. That regioselectivity allows us to distinguish between the external secondary cell wall and the inner middle lamellae. In that respect, for the untreated wood, we confirm that there is less lignin in the outer part of the cell wall than deeper inside. In treated wood, we determine that the role of dioxane during the process is to enable the extraction of the modified products from the cell wall. We show that the modified lignins which were not extracted in the absence of dioxane accumulate in a 40 nm region at the surface of the cell wall. Also, using carbon-13 enriched formaldehyde during the process, we show that 1% of the total amount of carbon in the material is assigned to self-polymerization and that no covalent bonds to cellulose are observed. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","","Biomass; Carbon; Cells; Cellulose; Cytology; Depolymerization; Biomass; Carbon; Cells; Cellulose; Cytology; Depolymerization; Ethers; Extraction; Formaldehyde; Lignin; Magic angle spinning; Polyols; Regioselectivity; Spin polarization; Spinning (fibers); Biomass pre treatments; Dynamic nuclear polarization; Lignin depolymerization; Lignin extractions; Lignocellulosic biomass; Secondary cell wall; Self-polymerization; Total amount of carbons; Wood","M.

Automotive industry is quick to respond to this huge challenge. One solution lies in making the vehicles lighter. That's why scope of the lightweight materials is more and more realized and explored during the last decade. One of the front runners in the lightweight material is Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). CFRP comes with own challenges in its understanding, designing and engineering. For effective use of the CFRP material, from a design and mass point of view, it has to be optimized in such a way that every section and layup is utilized to its maximum potential. Current paper demonstrates the multi-step optimization approach used in a design and development of car hood. Initial assessment of the hood showed that few attributes were falling short of the requirement targets, and could only be achieved with a mass penalty. After interaction with respective teams, scope for the optimization is realized. Topology optimization is utilized to derive the right structure from available design space, the reinforcer patterns and sections are worked out accordingly. Next step followed is the free-size optimization. Basic composite learnings are implemented in the development process. Results are used to decide the ply layups in different hood frame regions. Finally, hood model with the derived sections and ply information is updated for the manufacturing considerations and assessed for multiple domain performance. © 2019 SAE International.

This is achieved by the high design freedom of the process, allowing to tailor the fibre placement and by thereby fully exploiting the anisotropy and strength of the composite material. On the other hand, compliant or so-called morphing mechanisms – exploiting the elastic properties of the material to achieve shape changes – show great potential in improving the flight performance of aerospace structures. Such structures exhibit complex internal topologies, making them prohibitively expensive to manufacture with conventional processes. Combining additive manufacturing of composites with the utilization of morphing mechanisms has the potential to concurrently reduce manufacturing cost whilst greatly improving the flight performance of aerospace structures. The applicability of composite additive manufacturing to morphing aerospace structures is discussed in this letter.

Four parameters of feed rate, spindle speed, drilling diameter, and cushion plate were taken as the input layer parameters to study the manufacturing quality of holes in four stack types: CFRP/Al, Al/CFRP, Al/CFRP/Al, and CFRP/Al/CFRP. Delamination and tearing defects often appear in the drilling process; thus, a certain degree of defects in CFRP was selected as the output parameter, in an effort to build a prediction model of drilling quality. After the neural network model of the optimized hole-making process of an 8-14-1 three-layer topology was corrected by 170 steps, the error was reduced to 0.00016882, the regression fitting was 0.99978, and the fitting error of training samples was 10-2~10-5. The prediction model of the number of defective holes provided basically similar results to the experimental data. This indicates that the prediction model based on a BP neural network has good prediction ability. Based on the prediction of parameters, verification tests were performed, and the number of defective holes in CFRP was reduced while the manufacturing quality of the holes was improved significantly; the qualified rate of manufactured holes reached 97%. © 2020 by the authors.","CFRP; Drilling; Neural network algorithms; Quality prediction","","W.

This offers a unique opportunity in the design of these structures since the AM print path can potentially be defined in a direction that takes advantage of the enhanced stiffness gained in the bead and, therefore, fiber direction. This paper presents a topology optimization approach for continuous fiber angle optimization (CFAO), which computes the best layout and orientation of fiber reinforcement for AM structures. Statically loaded structures are designed for minimum compliance where the adjoint variable method is used to compute design derivatives, and a sensitivity filter is employed to reduce the checkerboard effect. The nature of the layer-by-layer approach in AM is given special consideration in the algorithm presented. Examples are provided to demonstrate the applicability of the method in both two and three dimensions. The solution to our two dimensional problem is then printed with a fused filament fabrication (FFF) desktop printer using the material distribution results and a simple infill method which approximates the optimal fiber angle results using a contour-parallel deposition strategy. Mechanical stiffness testing of the printed parts shows improved results as compared to structures designed without accounting for the direction of the composite structure. Results show that the mechanical properties of the final FFF carbon fiber/polymer composite printed parts are greatly influenced by the print direction, and optimized material orientation tends to align with the imposed force direction to minimize the compliance. © 2019 by the authors.","Additive manufacturing; Fused filament fabrication; Short fiber polymer composites; Topology optimization","","D.E.

Urban Air Mobility (UAM) aims to address this gap using hybrid and full-electric Personal Air Vehicles (PAVs) as a source of accessible, ondemand transportation. To achieve success with PAVs, reduction of mass is imperative due to the current battery capacity constraints. This can be achieved using advanced materials such as Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymers (CFRPs) paired with advanced design tools such as topology and composite optimization. Presently, existing literature in UAM design is focused on conceptual design optimization with high-level structural considerations for only conventional materials, which leaves significant weight savings unrealized. This work addresses this knowledge gap by presenting a structural optimization methodology for CFRP based UAM design applied to a PAV concept created in collaboration with Queen’s University, Konkuk University, and KCTECH. A comparison between a CFRP and a conventional aluminum design shows a mass reduction of 54.1% using CFRP construction while meeting the same design requirements. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

These systems require high speed motors designed for significant power levels. This paper considers the optimal design of a 50kW, 30,000 r/min bearingless motor. This design is based around a topology with a fractional slot-concentrated winding and a surface mount permanent magnet motor (the popular 4-pole, 6-slot design), making it a practical and potentially cost-effective design to manufacture. A parallel no voltage combined winding is designed so that the same coils that create torque can also be used to create suspension forces. The rotor magnets are retained via a carbon fiber banding, which is designed within the proposed optimization process. A multi-physics design framework is developed based around the differential evolution algorithm that considers both the electromagnetic design and the structural integrity of the rotor. Design metrics unique to bearingless motors are described and implemented. The final design achieves a maximum efficiency of nearly 96%, a safety factor of approximately 2 in the rotor structural analysis, and is able to support the rotor weight with only 2.5% of the rated armature current. © 2018 IEEE.","Bearingless motor; Differential evolution; Magnetic levitation; Multi-Physics; Optimization; Self-bearing motor","Carbon fibers; Cost effectiveness; Energy conversion; Evolutionary algorithms; Magnetic levitation; Optimal systems; Optimization; Permanent magnets; Safety factor; Surface mount technology; Winding; Active Magnetic Bearing; Bearingless motor; Differential Evolution; Differential evolution algorithms; Electromagnetic designs; Fractional slot concentrated windings; Multi-physics; Self-bearing motors; Electric motors","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85060294663"

Three laminate configurations were examined, [±45]2S [±55]2S and [±70]2S, and these configurations introduce varying magnitudes of shear and transverse stresses. The model was capable of predicting the evolution of plasticity and damage that result in a highly non-linear stress-strain behaviour.

Vitrimer consists of a covalently cross-linked network endowed with dynamic covalent bonds, which can be thermally activated to undergo bond exchange reactions, thus enabling the rearrangement of network topology without impairing its integrity. These bond exchange reactions lead to bulk stress relaxation and interface healing at the macroscopic scale, thereby allowing the vitrimer powder to fuse into a matrix embedded with the carbon fibers through a heat press process. We demonstrate for the first time that vitrimer composite samples can be fabricated within a few minutes (as short as 1 min) under different temperatures and pressures, which is significantly shorter than the time required for typical liquid-state manufacturing methods. Additionally, the malleability of the vitrimer matrix allows the composite to be reprocessed through thermoforming, which can greatly expand the manufacturing capability of fiber-reinforced composites. The fabrication method demonstrated in this paper has the potential to enable high volume manufacturing of fiber-reinforced composites in industrial sectors such as the automotive industry.

Among these challenges are thermal and gas transport within and between composite layers and the surrounding gas, coupled to the chemical degradation of composite materials. In this paper, we describe a new approach to modeling burning and thermal transport in carbon fiber-filled epoxy laminates via an ensemble of thermally interacting, chemically reacting Lagrangian particles. These particles are arranged in conformations analogous to the topology of a pile of composite rubble, where thermal conduction occurs within and between composite layers, a function of the particle positions, sizes, and constituent materials. Particle chemical reactions proceed according to prescribed mechanisms resulting in enthalpy, mass, species, and momentum transfer between particle and gas phases. Here we present the results of a small set of example scenarios to illustrate the efficacy of this approach.

Previously, this technology was called Rapid Prototyping. The term ‘rapid prototyping’ (RP) was used in a variety of industries to describe a process for rapidly production of parts before final release or commercialization [1]. Today, this term is not current, because now 3D printing is not used only for fabricating prototypes, but it is increasingly used for small-series production of final parts. This leads to higher requirements on sufficient strength and stiffness of these parts. This problem can be solved using advanced numerical simulations, which also allows to found appropriate solution in combination with structural optimizations. There are many types of structural optimizations (such as geometry, topography, topometry, shape or topology optimization). Topology optimization is one of the best optimizations for this purpose because it can find the best use of material within a given design space [2]. Its use is often overlooked because the final optimized shape of the part is often too complicated for conventional manufacturing technologies, but it is not for AM technologies. The goal of the paper was to find the appropriate methodology for optimizing a part for FDM fabrication using numerical simulations and topology optimization. The first stage of the intake system of a Yamaha YZF-R6 engine for a one-seat racing car was used as a typical part (a case study) for optimization. The simulation was done with respect to temperature. The PA6 copolymer with short carbon fibres was used as the material for the printed part. Experimental tensile testing of this material at temperatures up to 160 °C according to ISO standards was done to find the mechanical parameters [3]. The transverse isotropic mechanical properties of the material with high temperature dependency were found (see Figs. 1 and 2). The optimization was done using the NX Nastran 12 Topology Optimization solver with special manufacturing constrains for AM which allow the creation of a design with respect to minimum thickness of the walls, maximum angles for overhangs and an internal lattice structure. The optimized structure of the part with respect to FDM AM technology and sufficient stiffness and strength of the design was found using the designed methodology. The mass of the currently manufactured aluminium alloy part was reduced by more than 68%. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","Additive manufacturing; FEM; Topology optimization","","F.

However, exact reproduction of intricate, natural microvascular architectures is nearly impossible and thus there is a need to create practical, manufacturable designs guided by multi-physics principles. Here we present a Hybrid Topology/Shape (HyTopS) optimization scheme for microvascular materials using the Interface-enriched Generalized Finite Element Method (IGFEM). This new approach, which can simultaneously perform topological changes as well as shape optimization of microvascular materials, is demonstrated in the context of thermal regulation. In the current study, we present a new feature that enables the optimizer to augment network topology by creating/removing microchannels during the shape optimization process. This task has been accomplished by introducing a new set of design parameters, which act analogous to the penalization factor in the Solid Isotropic Material with Penalization (SIMP) method. The analytical sensitivity for the HyTopS optimization scheme has been derived and the sensitivity accuracy is verified against the finite difference method. We impose a set of geometrical constraints to account for manufacturing limitations and produce a design which is suitable for large-scale production without the need to perform post-processing on the obtained optimum. The method is validated by active-cooling experiments on vascularized carbon-fiber composites. Finally, we compare various application examples to demonstrate the advantages of the newly introduced HyTopS optimization scheme over solely shape optimization for microvascular materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Active-cooling; Hybrid topology/shape optimization; Interface-enriched generalized finite element method; Microvascular composites","3D printers; Blood vessels; Carbon fibers; Cell proliferation; Finite difference method; Finite element method; Hybrid materials; Topology; 3-D printing; Active cooling; Generalized finite element methods; Hybrid topologies; Microvascular; Shape optimization","J.F.

Therefore, metal reinforcements are usually necessary in local positions to prevent structure damage. Besides, if uncertainties present, obtained optimal structures may experience in failures as the optimization usually pushes solutions to the boundaries of constraints and has no room for tolerance and uncertainties, so robust optimization should be considered to accommodate the uncertainties in practice. This paper proposes a mixed topology method to optimize metal and carbon fiber reinforced plastic composite materials simultaneously under nondeterministic load with random magnitude and direction. A joint cost function is employed to contain both the mean and standard deviations of compliance in the robust optimization. The sensitivities of the cost function are derived with respect to the design variables in a nondeterministic context. The discrete material and thickness optimization (DMTO) technique is applied to undertake robust topology optimization for CFRP composites and metal material while the casting constraint to prevent intermediate void was introduced. In this study, two examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The robust topology optimization results exhibit that the composite structures with proper distribution of materials and orientations are of more stable performance when the load fluctuates. © 2019 SAE International.

To accommodate parameterization for thickness and orientation of CFRP materials, the discrete material and thickness optimization (DMTO) technique was adopted. To include metal material as a reinforcement structure into the optimization simultaneously, the DMTO technique was extended here to achieve concurrent optimization of CFRP thickness topology, CFRP orientation selection and the topology of the metal reinforcement plate. Manufacturing constraints were applied, including suppressing intermediate void across the thickness direction of the laminate, contiguity constraint and the symmetrical layers. Sensitivities of the objective function were derived with respect to design variables. To calculate analytical sensitivities, finite element analysis was conducted and strain vectors were exported from a commercial software (ABAQUS) into a mathematical analysis tool (MATLAB). The design objective was to minimize the local displacement subject to the constraints of manufacturing and mass fraction. The mechanical performance of the optimized CFRP structure was compared with the original steel structure. To validate the optimization results, a prototype of the CFRP battery-hanging structure was fabricated and experimental testing was conducted. The results show that the total mass of the CFRP battery-hanging structure was reduced by 34.3% when compared with the steel one, while the mechanical property was improved by 25.3%. © 2020 by the authors.

The wire shaped lithium-ion capacitor (WSLIC) assembly consists of multi-walled carbon nanotubes coated carbon fibers (CNT-CFs) core electrode, polymer electrolytes, lithium titanium oxide (LTO) composite outer electrode, helically wrapped current collectors and protective outer covering. This 2.7 V device exhibits a maximum energy density of 1.85 mWh/cm3, comparable to the energy densities of other reported wire-shaped batteries. WSLIC exhibits excellent safety at a high temperature of 60 °C due to plasticized polymer electrolytes of non-volatile composition, challenges may arise if flammable organic electrolytes were employed. The device also exhibits excellent electrochemical performance under different deforming and repeated bending conditions, attributed to unique properties of CNT-CF core electrode and helically wrapped current collectors.

The analytical expressions of bending stiffness of a multilayer sandwich structures for variable cross-section panel are determined. The obtained analytical bending stiffness is numerically verified using results of compressive buckling modes on wing panels from a numerical FE program and experimental tests by a series of stiffened structures which are empirically designed. Contrastive results demonstrate that the stiffener configuration tremendously affects the global buckling of the wing panels and the shapes, locations and intervals of the stiffeners which should be adjusted to construct a structure with maximum bending stiffness. Finally, with the use of the bi-directional evolutionary structural optimization method, the optimum design of the wing cross-section was determined by topology optimization method to pursue the best weight/stiffness.

The high number of mutually dependent parameters requires expert skills - and really good designs can only be obtained when load paths are considered appropriately, which is frequently missed out on when simply replacing isotropic material by quasi-isotropic laminate. Therefore, both commercial software solutions and approaches from research have been put forward to support engineers at finding adequate layups. In this paper, using a bike rocker arm demonstrator, a lightweight benchmark under displacement constraint is conducted with the goal of reducing mass using three approaches: OptiStruct (Altair), mfkCODE (from research) and a combination of a specific topology optimization algorithm for transversely isotropic materials and mfkCODE.

However, the honeycomb topology also provides modelling challenges when the disbonding between facesheet and sandwich core is to be modelled. The authors have previously shown that the disbonding between the facesheet and the honeycomb core of said sandwich panels cannot be accurately described by established cohesive zone formulations and a novel formulation was developed. The formulation requires a number of parameters which can be extracted from experiments by combining load displacement data on the one hand and digital image correlation strain data on the other hand. The parameter set was obtained for the interface between IM7/8552-1 prepreg tape and Hexcel 5052 aluminum honeycomb core bonded with FM 300K film adhesive, which constitutes the baseline design of the cargo fairing of the NASA Space Launch System (SLS). The novel formulation is comprised of two cohesive components, one of which is related to the initial interface traction while the other one is related to the bridging tractions in the wake of the crack tip. So far, this formulation has only been used to describe the mode I dominated delamination of single cantilever beam specimens. Subsequently, the formulation has been extended to account for mixed-mode disbonding. The newly developed formulation is applied to monolithic laminates as well as sandwich panels. Results obtained with the mixed-mode formulation are presented herein. © CCM 2020 - 18th European Conference on Composite Materials.

Instead of being disposed in landfills, recycled carbon fibers can fill the anticipated gap between supply and demand, especially because the production costs of carbon fibers remain high. One of the barriers to reintroducing recovered and recycled carbon fibers is the lack of an efficient method for surface treating reclaimed chopped fibers that have undergone recycling processes (e.g. pyrolysis) that leave the fiber surface essentially without functional groups that are required to ensure good fiber-matrix adhesion. For example, discontinuous fibers cannot be surface treated using conventional roll-to-roll electrochemical surface treatments that are used for continuous pitch- and poly(acrylonitrile)-based fibers. In this presentation, we describe novel methods for applying surface treatments to these discontinuous fibers via both electrochemical and wet chemical means. Changes in surface chemistry, and surface topology were quantified/monitored using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Specifically, we demonstrate broad control over surface oxygen and nitrogen concentrations and demonstrate that these are similar to those achieved via conventional surface treatments of continuous fibers by varying processing conditions (e.g., temperature, electrolyte concentration, ionic conductivity, reagent composition). Overall, our new method provides a scalable, effective means of surface treatment for discontinuous carbon fibers. Copyright 2019.

Materials scientist and clinicians initially opted for materials which exhibited high strength, non-toxic behaviour and inert as they are not any rejection by the human body. However, with time, the failures of these materials were encountered as their properties were not close to that of human tissues (Sakka and Coulthard in Med Oral Patol Oral Cir Bucal 16:e42–e44, 2011). Developing the right environment for cells to grow with the necessary biomolecules is the major focus and to achieve this scaffolds are being developed with various materials ranging from polymers to ceramics using different processes. Advancements in characterization techniques has thrown more light on the structure of human tissues and bone. Studies have shown that the unique properties of bone were attributed to its micro/nanostructures formed by the nanostructured collagen and apatite crystals (Palmer et al. in Chem Rev 108:4754–4783, 2008; Perez et al. in J Tissue Eng Regen Med 7:353–361, 2013). In order to mimic the bone, materials were modified at micro/nano level both at the bulk and surface level. Studies have also revealed that materials with nanograins have superior osseointegration capability when compared to conventional micron materials (Thakral et al. in J Clin Diagn Res 8:ZE07–ZE10, 2014). Surface characteristics such as surface chemistry, topography, roughness, stiffness and surface charge influenced the biocompatibility [Ferrari et al. in Colloids Interfaces 3:48, 2019). This understanding led to development of several nanomaterials for biomedical applications. In the case of metals, several processing techniques were developed to form nano grained materials, whereas, in polymers, various nanofibers were prepared and tested for their bioactivity. This chapter presents some of the important surface properties and their influence on the biocompatibility and describes the effect of nano versus micron surfaces on the cellular attachment. Further, nanofibers development on polymers has enhanced the scope for fabricating scaffolds that can potentially mimic the architecture of natural human tissue at the nanometer scale (Vasita and Katti in Int J Nanomedicine 1:15–30, 2006). The biomimicry by nanofibers made from biocompatible polymers has opened novel and innovative therapeutic avenues in the area of tissue regeneration. In recent years, a plethora of bio-nanofibers has been fabricated to imitate the natural extracellular matrix for cartilage tissue engineering. Nanofibers have broadened their horizons in the past five years for potential biomedical applications from triaxial fibers to electrospinning of drug-loaded polymer and ceramic composites (Kiran et al. in Ceram Int 45:18710–18720, 2019). However, the effect of surface topology on stem cells for cartilage regeneration and the biophysics involved in the stress distribution of nanofibers needs to be elucidated. Apart from this, the fine-tuning of metallic implant surfaces for enhanced chondro-integration and antibacterial activity is a need of the hour and clear understanding towards the sensitivity of various surface characteristics is also needed. Various modifications on the surface of metallic implants are done using different chemical and physical modification techniques. The commonly used techniques are anodization, laser texturing, hydrothermal treatments and sand blasting (Vishnu et al. in Nanomedicine Nanotechnology, Biol Med 20, 2019; Manivasagam and Popat in ACS Omega 5:8108–8120, 2020). Studies have shown that these modification have enhanced suitability for the implant material for the chondrocyte conduction by providing the necessary roughness and surface chemistry in the nanoscale level. Hence, in this chapter, a detailed discussion about different synthesis routes associated with nanofibers’ development for cartilage regeneration will be discussed. Along with this, the fabrication and effect of nanosurfaces on metallic implants for enhanced chondrocyte conductivity will also be highlighted. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021.","Anodization; Cartilage regeneration; Chondrointegration; Nanofibres; Nanosurfaces; Scaffolds","Biocompatibility; Biomimetics; Cartilage; Chemical modification; Drug delivery; Electrospinning; Functional polymers; Histology; Medical applications; Medical nanotechnology; Metal implants; Metals; Nanofibers; Natural polymers; Phosphate minerals; Polymeric implants; Stem cells; Surface chemistry; Surface roughness; Tissue; Tissue regeneration; Topography; Toxic materials; alkaline phosphatase; apatite; biomaterial; bone morphogenetic protein 2; calcium phosphate; carbon nanotube; cell penetrating peptide; chitosan; collagen type 1; collagen type 2; graphene; hyaluronic acid; hydrogel; hydroxyapatite; lidocaine; liposome; macrogol; metronidazole; molecular scaffold; myoglobin; nanocomposite; nanofiber; osteocalcin; osteopontin; polycaprolactone; polymer; polyvinyl alcohol; titanium; titanium dioxide; Anti-bacterial activity; Biomedical applications; Cartilage tissue engineering; Characterization techniques; Extracellular matrices; Hydrothermal treatments; Physical modifications; Surface characteristics; antibacterial activity; biocompatibility; biodegradability; biological activity; biophysics; bone conduction; bone development; bone regeneration; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell differentiation; cell proliferation; chondrogenesis; coil embolization; drug delivery system; electric conductivity; electrospinning; encapsulation; energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; extracellular matrix; freeze drying; human; mesenchymal stem cell; nanofabrication; nanosurface; nanotechnology; nerve conduction velocity; nerve regeneration; nonhuman; osseointegration; ossification; physiological stress; regenerative medicine; remyelinization; scanning electron microscopy; shear stress; soft tissue; surface charge; surface property; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; tissue regeneration; topography; zone of inhibition; Scaffolds (biology)","G.

In this study, methods of topology optimization and hybrid design are adopted for cutting tools. After a quick overview of its motivations, reduction of mass, the design of load paths, and beneficial functions within tool bodies, a structured method and its application on a long shell end mill for metal cutting is described as part of a holistic approach at the system and component levels. The manufacturing of the resulting geometry is examined for additive manufacturing. The optimized structures reduce the spindle power required, especially for acceleration to the desired speed; this, in turn, decreases the energy consumption of the process. Besides bearing static and dynamic loads, composites provide the adjustable option in process-stabilizing damping. In the field of wood cutting, the cutting forces are lower than those in the machining of metals. Here, we describe a planing tool with a large overhang and the first step in its development. The finite element analysis within the software Ansys Workbench and CompositePrep/Post (ACP), the special tool for modeling reinforced structures, are utilized for preparing the layout of the tool. To ensure the structural integrity of fiber reinforced plastic (FRP), the failure criteria proposed by Puck are applied. The overhanging planing tool is clamped on one side. It shows the principles for the development of a prototype and forms the basis for tools with even larger diameters and benefits. The underlying concept of the planing tool prototype is an innovative sandwich concept, wherein sleeves are used to join metal with carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) in a micro-forming process. Besides the abovementioned advantages, the reduction of acoustic emissions in the very noisy field of wood machining is a promising application. © 2020, Fuji Technology Press.

This study, a numerical, aims to minimize the weight of multilaminate composite aerospace structures using multiobjective optimization. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology started with the determination of the requirements, both imposed by the certifying authority and those inherent to the light, aerobatic, simple, economic and robust (LASER) project. After defining the requirements, the loads that the aircraft would be subjected to during its operation were defined from the flight envelope considering finite element analysis. The design vector consists of material choice for each laminate of the structure (20 in total), ply number and lay-up sequence (respecting the manufacturing rules) and main spar position to obtain a lightweight and cheap structure, respecting the restrictions of stress, margins of safety, displacements and buckling. Findings: The results obtained indicated a predominance of the use of carbon fiber. The predominant orientation found on the main spar flange was 0° with its location at 28% of the local chord, in the secondary and main web were ±45°, the skins also had the main orientation at ±45°. Originality/value: The key innovations in this paper include the evaluation, development and optimization of a laminated composite structure applied to a LASER aircraft wings considering both structural performance and manufacturing costs in multiobjetive optimization.

The robust topology optimization is considered here to minimize the fluctuation of structural performance induced by load uncertainty, in which a joint cost function is formulated to address both the mean and standard deviation of compliance. The sensitivities of the cost function are derived with respect to the design variables in a non-deterministic context. The discrete material optimization (DMO) technique is extended here to accommodate robust topology optimization for FRP composites. To improve the computational efficiency, the DMO approach is revised to reduce the number of design variables by decoupling the selection of FRP materials and fiber orientations. In this study, four material design examples are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.

With the recent availability of nanocarbon catalysts, the application of carbon materials in catalysis has gained a renewed momentum. The research is concentrated on tailoring the surface chemistry of nanocarbon materials, since the pristine carbons in general are not active for heterogeneous catalysis. Surface functionalization, doping with heteroatoms, and creating defects are the most used strategies to make efficient catalysts. However, the nature of the catalytic active sites and their role in determining the activity and selectivity is still not well understood. Herein, the types of active sites reported for several mainstream nanocarbons, including carbon nanotubes, graphene-based materials, and 3D porous nanocarbons, are summarized.

In the early years, the electrospun materials were mainly polymers and the morphologies were mainly fibers. Considerable progress has been achieved in the preceding two decades, which include electrospinning of metals, metal oxides, carbon species and organic/inorganic composites, and generating more morphologies beyond fibers such as beads, tubes and even hierarchical structures. In addition, a myriad of promising applications have been explored, mainly including biological, energy, catalysis, environment and mechanical enhancement, more than half focused on biological applications. Electrospun nanomaterials can be designed to mimic the structural features of an extracellular matrix for cell growth and nutrients transport. Such materials may be designed to enhance aesthetic wound healing, owing to the ability to absorb excess exudates, maintain a moist microenvironment to enhance epithelial regrowth, and offer painless to removal. Electrospun nanomaterials encapsulated or with attached bioactive molecules and drugs are regarded as suitable candidates for delivery applications. They may also be utilized in medical diagnosis to enhance the specificity, sensitivity and signaling capabilities due to the high porosity and large surface area. In addition, electrospun nanomaterials can be assembled into a variety of fascinating biomimic structures and functions. All these attributes make electrospinning a powerful tool for fabricating bio-functional nanomaterials for a range of biological applications concerning human health that mainly include tissue engineering, wound healing, drug/bioactive molecules delivery, diagnosis, and biomimetics. This review highlights recent advances in the topological design and biological applications of electrospun bio-functional nanomaterials. The topologies are categorized to portray a comprehensive “topology periodic table”, providing a concise and clear map offering a reference for scientists or engineers to opt for specific topology with desirable functions targeting a special application, as well as corresponding fabrication strategy. The topologies of electrospun nanomaterials are classified into three categories: Individuals, Hybrids and Assemblies according to the intrinsic logical relationships.

The reinforcement is placed tangentially to the critical cross section at the tooth fillet to improve bending strength. The mechanical modelling of the fibrous reinforcement is performed using an anisotropic material stiffness matrix derived from the analysis of a representative volume element using commercial stress analysis software. Benchmarking against conventional plastic gears illustrates that the maximum fillet stress, which is responsible for tooth failure in overloading conditions is greatly reduced, therefore rendering these gears suitable for considering their use in high load applications such as in the automotive industry. Also, the effect of the thickness of the reinforcement on the maximum developed tensile stress at the root is examined. The results show significant decrease of the bending stress at the root fillet rendering this design an alternative way in reinforcing plastic gears. © 2019 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.","Anisotropic modelling; Carbon fibres; Fibre orientation; Gears; Plastic reinforcement","Anisotropy; Automotive industry; Benchmarking; Gears; Reinforcement; Stiffness matrix; Stress analysis; Anisotropic material; Anisotropic models; Automotive plastic; Fiber reinforcement (e); Fibre orientation; Material stiffness; Mechanical modeling; Plastic gears; Stiffness matrices; Tooth fillets; Carbon fibers","V.

In this paper, out-of-plane defects in the layup are investigated. After draping, air pockets are occasionally encountered. The question is, if such apparent defects can be mitigated sufficiently during vacuum debulking. The 3D topology is measured by means of a structured-light 3D scanner and air pockets are segmented. An approximate mass-spring ply model is used to study the behavior of the air pockets during application of vacuum pressure. The model is computationally fast and will indicate online whether the air pocket will be removed or manual intervention is required.

However, the use of peel plies is not straightforward. It can be difficult to remove peel plies and a surface produced by a peel ply is altered in terms of roughness and elemental composition. In the present work, the influence of fluorine-based release agents on adhesive joining of carbon fibre reinforced composites is investigated. Within the scope of the screening, 14 fluorine-based release agents—ETFE release films, PTFE coated glass fabrics as well as fabrics made of PTFE fibres—were investigated. Preliminary studies (Meer, in: Deutscher Luft- und Raumfahrtkongress 2014, Augsburg, 2015) have shown that ETFE films have advantages in terms of adhesion. The study covers a number of aspects: the determination of the tear strength of the release agent by peel test; the determination of the element composition (XPS) and surface characteristics (SEM) before and after atmospheric pressure plasma pre-treatment, characterization the topology and the characterization of the adhesive strength by centrifugal adhesion test. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adhesion; CFRP; Contamination; Release agent","","M.

As a simulation, it is considered any computer process that imitates a real system by generating similar responses over time. Simulations allow the designers to create virtual prototypes that can speed up the design phase and, thus, the product development time in total. This design paradigm shift is called simulation-based design (SBD) and includes several simulations and optimization techniques. The most notable of these techniques are; computer-aided design (CAD), finite element analysis (FEA), topology optimization (TO), and parametric optimization (PO). A combined SBD methodology, including these techniques, is presented here. This methodology is a two-stage optimization process. During the first stage, traditional compliance TO using the SIMP approach was conducted, while at the second, a PO with an evolutionary algorithm was applied. The presented methodology is focused on the optimization of composite laminates. In particular, an angle-ply laminated beam made by carbon fiber reinforced polymer (FRP) was used as a case study and optimized both for its topology and fibers' direction. The results of this research are presented and tested using a commercial example. The suggested methodology resulted in a lighter and more robust design solution. These design solutions can be constructed either by conventional manufacturing processes (CMP) or by additive manufacturing (AM). Designers looking for interesting and lightweight composited structures can exploit the results found in this paper. The implemented process can easily be modified in order to cover any possible optimization of FRP products. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

Better structuring the constituents' materials near the sharp bends results in re-distribution of stress over a larger area and reduces the stress concentration. This is done by an integrally formed support structure that is spaced apart from the main body of the T-joint in the vicinity of the bend using a Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) foam. The support structure acts as a buttress across the bend and improves the performance of the T-joint. The T-joints are fabricated using wet layup process, from 2/2 twill TC35-carbon fibre fabric/SR5550 epoxy resin, and are subjected to quasi-static and fatigue bending, and quasi-static tensile pull-out tests. The quasi-static results reveal that the bio-inspired T-joint design has huge improvements compared to a conventional T-joint in the elastic stiffness (over 60%), peak load (over 40%) and absorbed mechanical energy (over 130%). There is only 3% weight increase in the bio-inspired T-joint compared to the conventional one.

Although much effort has been devoted to improving their mechanical properties, the underlying deformation mechanism of graphene fibers under tension still remains unclear. Here, we construct simulation models of graphene fibers with diameters of 10 and 20 nm using wrinkled graphene sheets with topological defects, hereafter referred to as graphene ruga sheets, as building blocks via a combination of the phase field crystal method and atomistic modeling. We then perform a series of large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of the constructed graphene fibers under uniaxial tension. Our simulation results revealed that the graphene fibers undergo plastic deformation with stress flow and that their tensile strength (i.e., the peak stress in the stress–strain curve) and Young's modulus increase with decreasing fiber diameter, which is mainly attributed to the decrease in the number of defects with reduced fiber diameter. Our simulations further revealed that the tensile strength is related to nanocrack nucleation/initiation from nanovoids or sharp corners between neighboring fused graphene sheets, while the flow stress is determined by interlayer slipping between neighboring graphene layers. Furthermore, we investigated the influence of structural continuity on the tensile strength of graphene fiber. The results showed that the tensile strength increases 1.9-3.5 times with the improvement in the structural continuity of graphene fibers within the investigated range. Our simulations provide mechanistic insights into the deformation mechanism of graphene fibers, which may be used to guide their design and fabrication. © 2020","Atomistic simulations; Crack nucleation; Graphene fibers; Graphene ruga sheets; Interlayer slipping; Structural continuity","Carbon fibers; Crystallization; Defects; Elastic moduli; Molecular dynamics; Nucleation; Tensile strength; Atomistic simulations; Crack nucleation; Deformation mechanism; High-tensile strength; Interlayer slipping; Large-scale molecular dynamics; Phase-field crystals; Structural continuity; Graphene","H.

However, their strong anisotropy reduces structural resistance to wall instabilities under shear and buckling. Increasing laminate thickness degrades weight and structural efficiencies and the application of a dense internal core is often uneconomical and labor-intensive. In this contribution, we introduce a convex linear semidefinite programming formulation for truss topology optimization to design an efficient non-uniform lattice-like internal structure. The internal structure not only reduces the effect of wall instabilities, mirrored in the increase of the fundamental free-vibration eigenfrequency, but also keeps weight low, secures manufacturability using conventional three-dimensional printers, and withstands the loads induced during the production process. We showcase a fully-automatic procedure in detail for the design, prototype manufacturing, and verification of a simply-supported composite machine tool component, including validation with roving hammer tests. The results confirm that the 3D-printed optimized internal structure almost doubles the fundamental free-vibration eigenfrequency, allowing to increase working frequency of the machine tool, even though the ratio between elastic properties of the carbon composite and the ABS polymer used for 3D printing exceeds two orders of magnitude. © 2019 The Authors Elsevier Ltd.","Additive manufacturing; Elastic instabilities; Experimental validation; Internal structure; Semidefinite programming; Topology optimization","ABS resins; Carbon carbon composites; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Fiber reinforced materials; Machine tools; Reinforcement; Shape optimization; Thin walled structures; Topology; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Elastic instabilities; Experimental validations; Internal structure; Manufacturing technologies; Semi-definite programming; Stiffness-to-weight ratios; Truss topology optimization; 3D printers","M.

The fracture morphology of composites shows massive pores and its bulk density is only about 1.03 g/cm3, which is far lower than metal material. Meanwhile, several assemble methods are used for the composites prepared by SLS, and the pulling-out force and failure behavior are assessed. At last, an equipment section support in rocket and the optimized structural support are prepared by SLS, and the weight of the optimized structural support is only 60% of the original. The results of load experiment shows these two supports both can withstand the load of 2 000 N without destruction and clear deformation, which demonstrated the feasibility and the potentials in the aerospace field of proposed method, as the technical advantage of SLS in the lightweight, rapid development and structure optimization. © 2019 Journal of Mechanical Engineering.","Additive manufacturing; Carbon fiber reinforced nylon12; Equipment section support; Selective laser sintering; Topology optimization","3D printers; Damping; Laser heating; Reinforcement; Rockets; Shape optimization; Sintering; Structural optimization; Tensile strength; Carbon fiber reinforced; Dynamic mechanical property; Lightweight composites; Nylon 12; Process parameter optimization; Selective laser sintering(SLS); Structure optimization; Thermoplastic composite; Selective laser sintering","X.

Six full-scale 1600 × 1600 × 150 mm slab specimens including one control steel reinforced concrete (RC) slab and five CFRP reinforced concrete slabs were fabricated and tested under monotonic loading till failure. The experiment aimed to investigate the effects of CFRP grids as flexural reinforcement and shear reinforcement on the punching behaviour of concrete slabs. Furthermore, three different shear reinforcement layouts were devised to verify which arrangement is better. Compared with the control RC specimen, the concrete slab with CFRP grids as flexural reinforcement reached almost the same punching strength with a lower reinforcement ratio. Moreover, adding extra shear CFRP grids was beneficial for improving the resistance of the concrete slab to punching. Among the three topological schemes of shear CFRP gird arrangements, the perpendicular layout was proven to be more effective than radial and rectangular arrangements. © 2020 Institution of Structural Engineers","CFRP grids; Concrete slab; Equivalent substitution; Punching shear; Shear reinforcement","","Z.

The MWCNTs patches were grown into three different topologies: uniform, fine patterned and coarse patterned. Hybrid carbon fiber-reinforced polymer composites (CFRPs) were fabricated based on the patterned reinforcements. Tensile tests, dynamic mechanical thermal analyses (DMTA) and flexure load relaxation tests were carried out to investigate the effect of the patterned nano-reinforcement on the static, dynamic, glass transition, and viscoelastic performance of the hybrid composites. Results revealed that the hybrid composite based on fine-patterned topology achieved better performance over all other configurations as it exhibited about 19% improvement in both the strength and modulus over the reference composite with no MWCNTs. Additionally, the increase in glass transition for this composite was as high as 13%. The damping parameter (tan δ) was improved by 46%. The stress relaxation results underlined the importance of patterned MWCNTs in minimizing the stress decay at elevated temperatures and loading conditions. Utilizing patterned MWCNTs topology significantly reduced the stress decay percentage at the thermomechanical conditions 60 MPa and 75 °C from 16.7% to 7.8%. These improvements are attributed to both the enhanced adhesion and large interface area by placing MWCNTs and by inducing an interlocking mechanism that allows the interaction of the three constituents in load transfer, crack deflection and hindering undesired viscoelastic deformations under different thermomechanical loadings. © 2020 by the authors.

RESS, which typically uses lithium-ion type battery, is posed to the danger of thermal runaway as an aftermath of intrusion into the battery cell structures. Thermal runaway might happen because the separators between the anode and cathode damage and fail that result in a short circuit. Nowadays, metallic structures have been applied underneath the cells to protect RESS. However, the protection cannot hold high-speed impact properly. This research focuses on a composite-based protective layer by using sandwich panel constructions to achieve a stiffer structure. The design and analysis of the sandwich composite structure was conducted using non-linear finite element analysis. The study involves multiple design variables to take into account variations such as layer thickness, topology, and fiber orientation. This research only uses plain weave Carbon Fiber Reinforced Polymer (CFRP). The variables that are set as performance indicators are mainly cell deformation and energy absorbed. Among the two topologies tested, Navy Truss (NavTruss) model is proven to have better performance compared to the Blast Resistant Adaptive Sandwich (BRAS) model. This due to the NavTruss structure absorbs energy by undergoing progressive crushing, while BRAS structure collapse within the supports. In the NavTruss itself, various orientations are tested, and it is found that the most effective orientation is [(0/90)2/[(±45)/(0/90)]3]s. The optimum NavTruss composite structure configuration appears to be more superior with 36 percent mass saving compared to the metallic structure. © 2019 IEEE.","BRAS; CFRP; composite; crashworthiness; NavTruss; RESS; sandwich panel","Accidents; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Composite materials; Crashworthiness; Electrodes; Electromagnetic wave emission; Energy storage; Honeycomb structures; Light weight structures; Lithium-ion batteries; Road vehicles; Sandwich structures; Structural optimization; Structure (composition); Topology; BRAS; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Energy storage systems; NavTruss; Non-linear finite-element analysis; RESS; Sandwich panel; Structure configuration; Structural design","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85081136698"

This manufacturing process employs a coreless translation cross-winding method in order to continuously deposit a roving around deflection points in space. On this basis, a design methodology is being created and deductively verified by designing a beam for a three-point bending load case. The composite beam is designed on a macro level simulation approach to match the stiffness of a reference aluminum profile, which is commonly employed as structural component for robotic gripper systems in automotive assemblies. The performance of the beams is subsequently compared by three-point bending experiments.

We know that adoption of a new material system involves significant effort in terms of time, resources, and cost for each application of each material system. These costs represent a nearly insurmountable obstacle to widespread adoption of ICME and prevent adoption of the structural concepts enabled by ICME. This paper introduces a bottom-up approach to the assessment of MoS for material systems and structural topologies that result from ICME. A bottom-up approach to MoS implies the use of physically consistent measures to predict the onset of damage initiation and fiber unloading. As such, a bottom-up approach is physics-based and uses measures that are scalars rather than vectors. The von Mises yield criterion for metals is an example of a bottom-up approach to the writing of MoS and is the first instance of the Onset method. The Onset method relies only on relating irreversible deformation to the exceedance of limiting values of scalar measures of the material constituents and provides a reliable and repeatable means to assess the MoS of any structural/material concept in ICME. In this paper, we will focus our numerical comparisons on carbon fiber reinforced polymers, since these are relatively common and have a body of test data for comparison. The Onset method is an alternative or extension mitigating the limited design space and high cost associated with current approaches which rely heavily on building block testing. It is, therefore, an effective tool to generate feasible concepts from topological optimization in ICME. © 2021, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The proposed cohesive model is applied to low fidelity (i.e. homogenized core representation) and high fidelity (i.e. directly accounting for the core topology) finite element models of a composite panel comprised of carbon fiber reinforced plastic facesheets and a honeycomb sandwich core. This enables the investigation of width-dependent effects such as 1.) the stress concentrations at the specimen edges, 2.) the stress concentrations due to the honeycomb core topology, 3.) the thumbnail-shaped crack growth, and 4.) the conditions under which the honeycomb core topology causes discontinuous crack propagation, which in turn begets oscillations of the global load-displacement curve. To this end, a cohesive parameter transfer procedure from 2D to 3D (low and high fidelity) is developed. Normal stresses of the 3D high and low fidelity predictions are qualitatively similar, whereas shear stresses in the sandwich core are significantly higher and very localized in the 3D high fidelity model. Crack propagation becomes noticeably unstable and global load-displacement curve oscillations occur for certain core topologies.

A dual trend is the increasing use of carbon fibre reinforced polymer (CFRP) for aircraft structures, due to the superior mechanical properties of CFRP compared to metallic structures. However, the poorer electrical conductivity of CFRP results in the aircraft structure no longer being fully integrated with the electrical power system. There is a need to integrate these two systems to fully maximize the performance benefits of CFRP, and optimize the weight and volume of the electrical power system. A first step in this integration is to identify an appropriate fault management strategy, which enables the detection of higher resistance ground faults through CFRP. This includes the consideration of appropriate grounding topologies. This paper proposes the implementation of a high resistance grounding topology, which enables the detection and location of a fault via spectral analysis of the voltage across the grounding resistor. From this, implications for wider EPS and CFRP designs to enable the reduction in the use of bulky cable harnesses, providing the first step to CFRP becoming an integral part of the EPS, are discussed. © 2019 by American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

In the same manner competences in new production technologies have been built up in the aerospace industry. However, current processes for developing and producing composites with an excellent mechanical performance cause high costs and long process cycles in comparison to approved metal processes. Furthermore, the used raw materials, such as carbon fibers and resin, are very expensive. In contrast to these technologies sheet molding compound is characterized by a very high productivity, excellent part reproducibility, cost efficiency and the possibility to realize complex components with integrated functions. The biggest disadvantage of sheet molding compound parts is a low level of stiffness and strength because of a low fiber-volume fraction and a short fiber length. In this context the combination of sheet molding compound (SMC) and pre-impregnated continuous fiber reinforcements in an in-situ compression molding and curing process merges the advantages of both materials to create load-bearing and autoclave-quality parts without an autoclave. The intention of the present work is the development of a finite element based simulation and optimization method for a new hybrid composite technology for aerospace applications which includes innovative material combinations and an efficient production process in equal measure. The whole development process for the technology is guided efficiently by implementing different numerical optimization methods. Modern simulation methods are applied for validating robust material models, design, dimensioning and calculation of composite or hybrid aircraft components which should be produced with this new technology. This includes a complete structural FEM-analysis, regarding to stresses, strains and rupture of the composite material component. Tools for optimization of topology and laminate will be implemented in order to design load-orientated structures with a minimum of material usage. In addition, the study is based on reference parts from aircraft interior for which functional patterns are designed and manufactured. Prototype testing is performed in order to validate the technology and the virtual optimization as well as simulation methodologies. Copyright 2019.

On the basis of standard micromechanical approaches, analytical elastic solutions for a single cell, assumed to be a Representative Volume Element (RVE), are ad hoc constructed by involving anisotropy induced by fiber orientation and volume fraction, also taking into account inter-laminar stresses and strains. The analytical solutions are then implemented in a Finite Element (FE) custom-made topology optimization-based procedure rewritten to have as output the best curves the reinforcing fibers have to draw in any composite laminate layer to maximize the overall panel stiffness or to minimize the elastic energy. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, different structures undergoing either in-plane or out-plane boundary conditions have been selected and theoretically investigated, determining the optimal fibers’ maps and showing the related results in comparison to standard sequences of alternate fibers disposition for the same composites. Two optimized panels were at the end actually produced using an innovative Automated Fiber Placement (AFP) machine and consolidating the materials by means of autoclave curing processes, in this way replicating the fiber paths obtained from theoretical outcomes. As a control, two corresponding composite structures were also built without employing the fiber optimization strategy. The panels have been tested in laboratory and the theoretical results have been compared with the experimental findings, showing a very good agreement with our predictions and confirming the capability of the proposed algorithm in suggesting the arrangement of the fibers to obtain enhanced mechanical performances. It is felt that the hybrid analytical-FE topology optimization strategy, in conjunction with the possibilities offered by AFP devices, could pave the way for a new generation of ultra-lightweight composites for aerospace, automotive and many industrial applications. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Analytical solutions; Automated Fiber Placement; Composite structures; Topology optimization","Autoclaves; Automation; Composite structures; Curve fitting; Elasticity; Laminated composites; Paper laminates; Shape optimization; Strain; Structural design; Structural optimization; Structure (composition); Topology; Different structure; Fiber placement; Mechanical performance; Micromechanical approach; Optimization strategy; Prescribed displacements; Representative volume element (RVE); Topology Optimization Method; Fibers","M.

However, templates are commonly utilized for the preparation of HPCs, and the postremoval of the templates is uneconomical, time-consuming, and harmful for the environment in most cases. Herein, a new humidity-induced nontemplating strategy is developed to prepare 1D HPC with rich topologies and interconnected cavities for catalysis and energy storage applications. Porous electrospun nanofibers as calcination precursors are prepared via a humidity-induced phase separation strategy. A nitrogen-doped hierarchical porous carbon nanofiber (HPCNF), loading Co/Co3O4 hetero-nanoparticles as exemplary nonprecious-metal active substance (Co/Co3O4@HPCNF), is fabricated through the subsequent hydrothermal and pyrolysis treatment. The internal mesopore and cavity structure can be simply controlled by varying environment humidity during the electrospinning process. Benefiting from the unique topology, Co/Co3O4@HPCNF exhibits superior bifunctional activity when being used as electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction/evolution reactions. Moreover, the hybrid catalyst also demonstrates a remarkable power density of 102.5 mW cm−2, a high capacity of 748.5 mAh gZn−1, and long cycle life in Zinc–air batteries. The developed approach offers a facile template-free route for the preparation of HPCNF hybrid and can be extended to other members of the large polymer family for catalyst design and energy storage applications. © 2020 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

It is designed to measure up to 1000 particles in nucleus-nucleus collision at interaction rates up to 10 MHz, to achieve a momentum resolution better than 2% inside a 1 Tm magnetic field, and to be capable of identifying complex particle decays topologies, e.g., such with strangeness content. The STS comprises 8 tracking stations equipped with double-sided silicon microstrip sensors. Two million channels are read out with self-triggering electronics, matching the data streaming and online event analysis concept of the experiment. The STS functional building block is a module, consisting of a sensor, micro-cables and two front-end electronics boards. The modules are mounted on carbon fiber support ladders. The sensors provide double-sided segmentation at a strip pitch of 58 m and 7.5-degree stereo angle. Ultra-thin micro-cables with length up to 50 cm transfer the sensor signals to the electronics located out of the detector acceptance. The custom-developed readout ASIC has a self-triggering and radiation hard architecture that delivers time and amplitude information per channel. Particular design choices and features of the GBTx-based readout are motivated by the high data rate for which the experiment is designed. In mCBM, the FAIR phase 0 precursor setup of CBM, the STS deployed a prototype of one small tracking station with full readout chain. This allowed evaluating the performance in Ag+Au collisions at different interaction rates, up to 106. Moreover, the detector was successfully integrated with other subsystems into a freestreaming DAQ. This paper aims to describe the main technical challenges and prospects for the STS and to present the results of the latest testing campaign. © 2019 IEEE.","CBM experiment; free-streaming; heavy ion collision; readout chain; silicon detectors; Silicon Tracking System","Cables; Carbon fibers; Colliding beam accelerators; Heavy ions; Medical imaging; Silicon; Tracking (position); Accelerator facilities; Amplitude information; Charged particle identification; Front end electronics; Momentum resolutions; Nucleus-nucleus collision; Silicon micro-strip; Technical challenges; Stereo image processing","A.R.

This is achieved by mitigating both hydrogen diffusion and water ingression onto the fiber surface. Notwithstanding the advanced performance of CVD-deposited a-C films, their functionality may suffer from structural and topology defects, dopants, intrinsic stresses, and other imperfections. In this paper, we experimentally study the influence of water-anchored edge functional groups on dc electrical conductivity and Raman scattering of a-C films, ranging from 10 to 100 nm in thickness, exposed to thermal and electrical annealing. A series of heating/cooling cycles was found to affect the disorder D-family bands in the Raman spectra of a-C. In particular, two new Raman peaks at 1260 and 1400 cm-1, attributed to carboxyl (COOH) and hydroxyl (C-OH) groups, have been unraveled through polarization-controlled far-field Raman spectroscopy and tip-enhanced Raman scattering (TERS) spectroscopy. The TERS technique allows one to readily resolve the broad disorder D-family bands due to the excitation of coherent Raman scatters (nanosized graphitic clusters). A temperature-sensitive and thickness-dependent hysteresis in dc conductivity, observed at temperatures of above 80 °C, is explained by physical sorption/desorption of water at the surface of graphite-like crystals through hydrogen bonding and dissociative absorption of water with the formation of extra COOH/C-OH groups at the edge defects. The electroheating leads to a nonuniform distribution of the water-decorated edges owing to hot spots of a percolated carbon crystals network. This is directly evidenced by electroassisted TERS mapping of the a-C coating. We believe that our study will pave a way for the understanding of how water interacts with amorphous carbon and improve the performance of carbon coatings in harsh environments.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.","","Amorphous carbon; Coatings; Crystals; Hydrogen; Hydrogen bonds; Optical fibers; Raman scattering; Raman spectroscopy; Silica; Aggressive environment; Amorphous carbon (a-C); DC electrical conductivity; Dissociative absorptions; Non-uniform distribution; Silica optical fibers; Temperature sensitive; Tip-enhanced Raman scatterings; Water absorption","S.S.

In this paper, we aim to improve the normalized compliance of a beam in a three-point bending scenario, using a skeletal reinforcement for a topology in which the change in fibre orientation is derived from the medial axis information. FDM with a dual-nozzle system printing nylon and carbon fibre filaments were utilized for fabrication. The toolpath i.e. reinforcement strategy available from the commercial software Eiger® was chosen to imitate the proposed strategy. The numerical investigation is complemented with experimental tests and a general benchmarking is conducted using standard pedants. The results have shown improved specific flexural stiffness for samples with skeletal reinforcement. The skeletal information is therefore considered as important tool for the retrieval of fibre angles which align with the principle stresses and therefore allow for a more efficient fibre placement in AM parts for future lightweight end-use parts. © Solid Freeform Fabrication 2018: Proceedings of the 29th Annual International Solid Freeform Fabrication Symposium - An Additive Manufacturing Conference, SFF 2018.

Modal testing is conducted to investigate vibration characteristics of such composite corrugated sandwich cylindrical shells with free-free boundary condition. In order to predict the structural vibration damping, a finite element model combined with modal strain energy approach is developed, which is adequately consistent with the experimental results. It is shown that the first several orders of vibration mode shapes are dominated by circumferential lobar modes. Circular corrugated sandwich cylindrical shells generally possess higher natural frequencies and damping loss factors than axial corrugated sandwich cylindrical shells since circumferential stiffness and damping capacity of the former are higher than those of the latter. Furthermore, the influence of the corrugated inclination angle, sandwich core thickness and different topological corrugated cores on the structural vibration and damping performances are thoroughly investigated, which might be helpful to guide the manufacturing and dynamic analysis of lightweight cylindrical shells in engineering. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","A.

At either extreme, an undesirable speed of deployment could result in (a) only partial deployment if too slow or (b) damage to the tape spring and/or removal of attached articles if too fast. While traditionally tape springs have been fabricated to maintain a uniform distribution of material and geometric properties, this study proposes that an optimal distribution of material and geometric properties can be used to achieve a desirable speed of deployment. This paper develops the foundation for the design optimization of a FlexLam carbon fiber tape spring for desired deployment speed. The deployment response of the tape spring was simulated using finite element (FE) analysis. A parametric study was performed to identify the critical design variables in the tape spring optimization problem with the objective of achieving a desirable speed of deployment. Both uniform and gradient changes in composite tape spring thickness, width, stiffness, density, and ply angle were investigated. Results show that uniform changes in thickness and ply angle, as well as gradient changes in tape spring width, have a considerable effect on the deployment speed. The critical range for the variable thickness was bounded between 0.05 mm and 0.5 mm. The critical range for the fiber orientation of the middle unidirectional ply was between 0° and 90°. The critical range for the gradient width ranged between 12.7 mm and 25.7 mm, specifically with the width increasing from the fixed end of the tape spring to the free end. The results from the parametric study pave the road to conducting an effective multi-objective topological design optimization of deployable tape springs.","","Carbon; Carbon fibers; Finite element method; Optimization; Speed; Aerospace components; Composite tape-springs; Design optimization; Material and geometric properties; Optimal distributions; Optimization problems; Structural performance; Uniform distribution; Springs (components)","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85013943912"

These small helicopters consist in a fuselage ""hanged"" under a set of fixed pitch propellers each powered by an electric motor. These vehicles have great potentials and research in this topic is increasing aimed to reduce the structure weight to maximize flight time, range and payload. Multi rotor components represent a key challenge for 3D modeling, optimization and additive manufacturing: they mainly consist in complex shapes where the most important feature are robustness and lightweight. Usually produced in small series, for example, eight parts for a single prototype, they almost need to be able to interface different materials. The work here presented shows the advanced research conducted in cooperation between Altair Engineering and Politecnico di Torino to develop vital components for the structure of a multi-rotor: they represent a challenge because the main need is to interface arms, consisting in carbon fiber tubes, with motor or frame, both made in 7075 Alloy. The use of topology optimization techniques plays a key role to minimize the weight of the components and to improve the productivity of the machines. Moreover, Additive manufacturing (FDM with Sharebot NG) allows producing more parts in less time improving the cost effectiveness of the project. The process will be described from a simple characterization of the anisotropic properties of 3-D printed specimens to FEM analysis of the preliminary design of the component and to the optimization phase performed with Altair Optistruct code. An important role is played from the Altair tool used for the preliminary design: Inspire. This tool is conceived to generate structural efficient concepts quickly and easily to obtain lighter designs and eliminate structural design problems and finally provide input files for 3-D printers. © 2016 The Authors.","3dprinting; Additive Manufacturing; AM; concept design; concepts; FDM; multi rotor; Optimization; Sharebot","Helicopters; Optimization; Printing; Three Dimensional Design; 3D printers; Americium; Carbon; Carbon fibers; Computer aided engineering; Cost effectiveness; Design; Engineering research; Frequency division multiplexing; Interfaces (materials); Manufacture; Optimization; Shape optimization; Structural design; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); 3D-printing; Anisotropic property; Concept designs; concepts; Fixed pitch propellers; Optimization techniques; Sharebot; Structural design problems; Industrial research","C.

This study contributes a numerical approach of topologically optimal design of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP) to retrofit existing beam-column connections with crack patterns. In recent, CFRP is used commonly in the rehabilitation and strengthening of concrete members due to the remarkable properties, such as lightweight, anti-corrosion and simplicity to execute construction. With the target to provide an optimal CFRP configuration to effectively retrofit the beam-column connection under semi-failure situation such as given cracks, extended finite element method (X-FEM) is used by combining with multi-material topology optimization (MTO) as a mechanical description approach for strong discontinuity state to mechanically model cracked structures. The well founded mathematical formulation of topology optimization problem for cracked structures by using multiple materials is described in detail in this study. In addition, moved and regularized Heaviside functions (MRHF), that have the role of a filter in multiple materials case, is also considered. The numerical example results illustrated in two cases of beam-column joints with stationary cracks verify the validity, benefit and supremacy of the proposed method.

The effect of various surface treatments of the carbon fibers on the in-plane and out-of-plane mechanical performance of the hybrid CFRPs (e.g., exposure to or shielding against elevated temperatures, patterned vs. unpatterned growth of the CNTs over the carbon fibers) were investigated. The in-plane quasi-static mechanical properties and out-of-plane dynamic properties of the hybrid CFRPs were examined utilizing tension and dynamic impact tests, respectively. To study the progressive damage mechanism of the hybrid CFRPs, spherical punch tests as well as X-ray radiography of the impact damaged hybrid CFRPs were carried out.

Carbon nanotubes are incorporated in the polymer matrix of CFRPs for the enhancement of their electrical properties. The electrical properties have shown to be sensitive to the damage state of the material and hence their monitoring provides the profile of their structural deterioration. The aim of the paper is the cross-validation and benchmarking of an electrical potential change monitoring (EPCM) technique against acoustic emission (AE) and lock-in thermography (LT). All techniques successfully identified damage and its propagation. Thermography was more efficient in quantifying damage and describing dynamically the debond topology, as it provided full 2D imaging of the debond in real time. EPCM was successful in providing quantitative information on debond propagation and its directionality. AE provided consistent information on damage propagation. All techniques identified three stages in the fatigue life of the interrogated coupons. The representation of the fatigue behavior as a function of life fraction, the correlation of AE data with EPCM and LT data, and most importantly the consistent behavior of all tested coupons allowed for both the direct and indirect cross-correlation of all employed methodologies, which consistently identified all aforementioned fatigue life stages. © ASM International.","Aerospace composites; Non-destructive evaluation; Repair","Acoustic emission testing; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Damage detection; Fatigue of materials; Repair; Thermography (imaging); Aerospace composites; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Electrical potential; Non destructive evaluation; Properties of composites; Quantitative information; Structural deterioration; Thermographic method; Electric properties","A.S.

Over the past decade, out-of-autoclave/vacuum bag-only (OoA/VBO) processing has been proposed as a low-cost alternative to traditional autoclave cure of high-performance structures. However, to date, VBO methods remain insufficiently robust and efficient. The initial distribution of uncured resin within prepreg plies significantly influences part quality in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) laminates fabricated using OoA/VBO processes. Generally, in-plane air evacuation paths formed by reducing the level of impregnation can expedite air removal and ultimately improve part quality relative to fully saturated prepreg plies. Recently, research has also shown that internal and surface defects can further be reduced by designing fabric-based prepreg with optimized through-thickness permeability, achieved through selective deposition of uncured resin on tow overlaps, with underlaps remaining dry. However, since creation of through-thickness evacuation paths relies on the weave pattern of the fabric, this method cannot be directly translated to unidirectional (UD) fiber systems. Here, we introduce UDSCpreg - a prepreg system developed in-house and comprised of a UD fiber bed partially impregnated with discontinuous strips of uncured resin. UDSCpreg is fabricated using a mask-and-press process to customize prepreg format by controlling strip geometry and degree of penetration into the fiber bed. Laminates comprised of UDSCpreg are cured under ideal as well as sub-optimal processing conditions, and the defect contents are compared against a commercial prepreg system (CYCOM 5320-1). Results confirm that the increased through-thickness permeability of UDSCpreg leads to improved part quality and resistance to sub-optimal cure conditions compared to commercial OoA prepregs. Additionally, evidence is offered that minor differences in the degree of uncured resin penetration and the topology of resin strips may influence part quality in UDSCpreg systems (especially the proportion and distribution of surface defects). These results corroborate the assertion that though thickness permeability is critical in the design of robust OoA/VBO prepreg formats and demonstrate that transverse pathways are achievable in UD fiber systems. Looking forward, the development of robust VBO prepreg formats will encourage the transition from autoclave cure of performance critical composites toward manufacturing methods with improved technical, cost, and environmental efficiency. © 2017 The Composites and Advanced Materials Expo (CAMX).

To accommodate multiple loading conditions, the weighted mean compliance of the CFRP vehicle door was taken as the objective function, subject to the constraints on the local displacements, primary natural frequency and manufacturability. The sensitivities of objective and constraints were calculated by using the strain vectors, which is a more general method than using element stiffness matrices and allows extracting local displacements from the commercial finite element code. A gradient-based algorithm was employed in the DMO approach to tackle the large-scale problem. In the discrete topology optimization, four material penalization schemes were attempted in this study. The proposed DMO approach was compared with the empirical design and the existing method in commercial software. The results demonstrated that the proposed method is able to produce a more competent solution than the empirical design and other optimization methods efficiently. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP); Discrete Material Optimization (DMO); Ply orientation; Topology optimization; Vehicle door","ABAQUS; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Commercial vehicles; Fiber reinforced plastics; MATLAB; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Shape optimization; Stiffness matrix; Supports; Topology; Vehicles; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP); Commercial finite element codes; Commercial software; Discrete material optimizations; Gradient based algorithm; Mathematical analysis; Ply orientation; Vehicle doors; Finite element method","Y.

However, traditional design methods and most relevant structural optimization methods always design sandwich structures considering single constraint, such as constraint of material volume or nodal displacement. Sandwich structures in modern engineering are in highly complex circumstances where strict mechanical, thermal, electromagnetic and functional requirements may be put forward. In this paper, a multi-constraint topology optimization method for sandwich structure with CFRP (Carbon Fibre Reinforced Polymer) face sheets is proposed. The metal core of sandwich structure is optimized based on a ground structure under structural stability constraint, adhesive-area constraint and embedding-volume constraint. In numerical examples, the single-constraint case and the multi-constraint case are both considered, and the results indicate that different conditions of constraints have remarkable influence on the topology of cores of sandwich structure. Sandwich structures with grid core and hybrid core (hybrid of grid core and honeycomb core) can be obtained through topology optimization in single-and multi-constraint cases, respectively. © 2017 International Committee on Composite Materials.

Getting inspiration by the ultralight structure ribs of leaves and wings in nature with excellent structural rigidity and strength, gradient structure strengthening ribs has been added on membranes to enhance their ability of resist tearing. The problem that spacecraft membranes is easier to be tore open has been mainly focused in this paper, and biomimetic strengthening ribs structure has been proposed for a space membrane structure which used interdisciplinary strengths, such as bionic technology, topological optimization technology, composite materials technology, and rapid prototyping. The optimization method and process method of biomimetic strengthening ribs has been studied. Through topology optimization, biomimetic ribs with good tensile and tear capacity has been obtained via ABAQUS. The topology optimization structure has been remodeled via three-dimensional model. Carbon fiber reinforced PEEK composites which having priority of thermal stability and good processing properties in strengthening ribs of membranes structure has been selected. FDM technology has been utilized to print the strengthening ribs of membranes. Deformation and tearing of two kinds of membranes with and without strengthening ribs has been compared by tear-resistance tests. Experimental results showed that membrane with biomimetic strengthening ribs structure has better mechanical properties, and has important significance to avoid membrane tear and ensure the spacecraft orbital lifetime.

An improved assessment of the quality of any composite material is achieved by identification and simulation of the inherent uncertainty in the reinforcement geometry. By following this strategy, many random realistic representations of the textile reinforcement can be generated based on experimental data of only a few textile samples. This work presents such a roadmap with its successive steps to characterise the spatial scatter in the internal structure of any textile composite (short- and long-range) and simulate random models possessing the measured statistical information on average.

As the manufacturing technology develops, the geometry of CFRC components has seen significant changes, such as closed surface from the traditional open surface, or quite sophisticated topologies from simple shapes. As a result, fabrication of CFRC is confronted with challenging issues related to the design of fiber placement trajectory for optimal performance. In this paper, a trajectory generating algorithm is proposed based on the centroid curve of a quasi-rotational structure, where the centroid curve is the connection of centroids of the cross-sections of the structure. After the centroid curve of the component is achieved, the cross-section profiles perpendicular to the centroid curve can be determined. An efficient number of profiles are identified to avoid any overlap among neighboring profiles along the centroid curve. In this manner, the essential data for ultimate trajectory design are eventually obtained that can precisely reflect placement angles. The present work will effectively enhance the accuracy of trajectory of fiber placement and promote the mechanical property of CFRC components. © 2018 Canadian Society for Mechanical Engineering.

The numerical simulations are performed within the framework of a finite element analysis. The macroscopic effective material properties are determined from microscopic properties using a homogenization and a representative volume element (RVE) approach. An elastic–plastic model is used to describe the mechanical behavior of the steel fibers and the epoxy resin, while the carbon fibers are modeled as a linear elastic material. The nonlinear stress–strain curves are determined under macroscopic longitudinal and transversal tensile as well as under shear loads. Moreover, 2D and 3D failure envelopes are computed. By using hexagonal-, square- and micrograph-based RVEs, the influences of fiber arrangements and different volume fractions of the carbon and steel fibers are investigated. Finally, the simulation results for tensile loads in fiber direction are compared with the experimental results of comparable topologies made of steel and carbon fiber reinforced plastics. The modeling and computational approach used in this study correlates with the experimentally determined, effective properties of hybrid composites in the tensile test. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Epoxy resins; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Finite element method; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Tensile testing; Computational approach; Effective material property; Hybrid polymer composite; Linear elastic material; Mechanical behavior; Microscopic properties; Model and simulation; Representative volume element approach (RVE); Steel fibers","J.

A number of material systems have been proposed and demonstrated for THz plasmonic resonators, including doped semiconductors, materials with metallic behavior, such as graphene, graphite, and carbon nano-tubes, superconductors and topological insulators. However, experimental investigations of THz plasmonic resonators, which are typically a fraction of the free space wavelength in size, remain challenging. We demonstrate that THz near-field spectroscopy and imaging technique based on a subwavelength aperture probe can be employed to detect excitation of THz plasmons in carbon micro-fibers. Upon excitation of a single carbon fiber by a THz pulse, we observe a standing wave formed along the fiber length. The resonant frequency is consistent with the fundamental dipole mode, both in its value and in its dependence on the fiber length. The field of the standing wave is localized and it indicates the plasmonic nature of the excitation. The fact that the resonance frequency also depends on the material conductivity allows us to employ the THz near-field spectroscopy method to evaluate the material conductivity non-invasively. Furthermore we propose an alternative method for non-contact conductivity probing. It utilizes the relative amplitude of the surface plasmon field that can be measured by the near-field probe. The amplitude increases with the fiber conductivity and therefore it can be used for conductivity estimation. © 2016 SPIE.","graphite; near-field microscopy; plasmons; resonators; terahertz; terahertz time-domain spectroscopy","Carbon fibers; Carbon nanotubes; Elastic waves; Fibers; Graphite; Imaging techniques; Nanoelectronics; Nanotubes; Natural frequencies; Near field scanning optical microscopy; Plasmons; Polyethylenes; Probes; Resonators; Spectroscopic analysis; Terahertz waves; Time domain analysis; Conductivity estimation; Experimental investigations; Material conductivities; Near field microscopy; Near-field spectroscopy; Subwavelength apertures; Tera Hertz; Terahertz time domain spectroscopy; Terahertz spectroscopy","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84986910267"

For this reason, components in the drivetrain, such as the two-stage transmission typical of electric drives, must offer an optimal weight while meeting all requirements. The weight of this transmission can be reduced by substituting materials of a lower specific weight for the existing housing materials. A very interesting possible material here with regard to its mechanical properties is a carbon-fiber-reinforced thermoplastic matrix in combination with the possibilities established in production. The most challenging demand made of this combination of materials in a transmission housing is compliance with the rigidity values required, even at operating temperatures above 100 °C. These have a significant impact on the service life and acoustics of the transmission and therefore decisively determine the geometric design. In this project, the aluminum housing of a conventional electric transmission was replaced by a housing made of fiber-reinforced thermoplastic. The basic approach to satisfying all of the requirements made of the transmission housing provides for using an organo-sheet (thermo-plastic) which is overmolded with a short-fiber-reinforced plastic. A significant reduction in shaft tilting is made possible by using aluminum inserts which can transfer to the organo-sheet the loads introduced in the bearings. Rigidity targets can be achieved with the aid of additional injection-molded ribs and UD tapes. In the development phase, the various concepts are examined morphologically with the aid of FE analyses and their feasibility assessed. Whether the concepts can be produced or not is assessed in compression-and injection-molding simulations, and optimizations carried out as necessary. The load paths of the housing are determined with the aid of topology optimizations, taking tension and compression ranges into account. The constructive design so derived serves as a geometric starting point for optimizing the layers of the organo-sheet, and optimization of the UD tapes and injection-molded ribs. Tool production, which is tightly bound into the development process, secures producibility, with the first prototypes of a housing half being manufactured in a two-step process. In the first step, the organo-sheet and the reinforcing UD tapes are heated and then shaped within a compression process. The outer contour is then created by water-jet cutting. In the second step, the organo-sheet is heated again and then overmolded in order to create the ribbing geometry and thus the final shape. © 2021, VDI Verlag GMBH.

Since carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites (CFRPs) are electrically anisotropic and typically exhibit relatively low conductivities which are directionally distinct, aerospace manufacturers frequently use metallic foil layers or an expanded metal mesh on outer surfaces of composite structures for lightning strike protection. Due to irregular topology and associated micro-texture of machined holes in composites it is shown non-uniform interface surfaces between the fastener and composite layers reduces electrical continuity, thereby impeding current flow as a result of increased contact resistance levels. Furthermore, lightning strike experiments have indicated that metal mesh intimacy around the perimeter of the fastener head directly affects overall electromagnetic response of the rotorcrafts outer surface when subjected to lightning currents due to impedance modification of the electrical network. The effect of electrical continuity between the fastener head and mesh strand contact points is calculated using a Multiphysics model to demonstrate the effects on current load distribution and fusing lifetime of the individual strands. Additionally, total number of fastener-mesh strand contact points and cross sectional area of each strand are shown as being important parameters which ultimately determine the amount of lightning current efficiently transferred across the rotorcraft skin surface. © 2017 by the American Helicopter Society International, Inc.","","Building materials; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Electric contacts; Fiber reinforced plastics; Locks (fasteners); Mesh generation; Metals; Rotors; Carbon fiber composite; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer composite; Cross sectional area; Electrical continuity; Electromagnetic response; Expanded metal meshes; Lightning strike protection; Multi-physics modeling; Lightning","A.

In this paper we report the design and performance of a multistage high-power PM Tm-doped fiber amplifier, cladding pumped at 793 nm. The design is the result of a careful comparison of numerical simulation, based on a three level model including ion-ion interactions, and experiment. Our simulation model is based on precise measurements of the cross sections and other parameters for both 6 and 10 μm core diameter fibers. Good agreement for several single and multistage amplifier topologies and operating conditions will be presented. Origins of the difference between theory and experiment are discussed, with emphasis on the accuracy of the cross sections and the cross relaxation parameters. Finally based on our simulation tool, we will demonstrate a design with an output power greater than 10 W for a multistage amplifier with a single-frequency signal at 2050 nm. The power stage was constructed with a 6 μm active fiber showing a 64 % optical slope efficiency. The output power is found to be within 5 % of the simulated results and is limited only by the available launched pump power of ∼24 W. No stimulated Brillouin scattering is observed at the highest output power level for an active fiber well thermalized. © 2017 SPIE.","Brillouin; Cross section; Multistage; Simulation; Single frequency fiber amplifier; Thulium","Brillouin scattering; Carbon dioxide; Fiber lasers; Fibers; Optical radar; Thulium; Brillouin; Cross section; Multistage; Simulation; Single frequency; Fiber amplifiers","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85019470555"

It is a promising technique when compared to conventional machining which has inherit problems like extensive damage and dust generation. Till now material integrity of the composite structures machined by AWJ process are not well investigated. In the present work, influence of AWJ milling parameters on the surface characteristics and size of damage (craters) are investigated for carbon/epoxy composite specimens using full experimental design. The surface quality was characterized by 2D Profilometry, 3D optical topography and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) observation. In addition, surface topologies were analyzed to obtain roughness parameters and crater volume, which were correlated with machining parameters. SEM images reveal the presence of damages (in the form of craters, ridges, broken fibers and embedded abrasive particles in matrix) whose size is strongly influenced by the machining parameters. It is seen that the average crater volume increases by 350% when pressure varies from 80 MPa to 140MPa. ANOVA technique indicates that surface roughness and crater volume are highly influenced by jet pressure and formation of ridges is influenced by scan step compared to other parameters. © 2016, European Conference on Composite Materials, ECCM.

Specific interest is in the analysis of local stress-strain states of composite repair, where digital image correlation (DIC) technique seems to be especially helpful. Thus, the objective is to develop and demonstrate a DIC-based experimental approach for analysis of repaired zones in composite structures including characterization of damage initiation and growth. The approach is based on experimental analysis of through-thickness distributions of internal strains as a function of applied load. Corresponding test coupons are either cut from actual repaired structures or specifically manufactured to represent topology, geometry, lay-up and properties of repaired structures. Demonstration of the approach is considered on an example of generic laminated carbon fiber composites IM7-977-3 with different lay-ups and geometrical configurations of repaired solutions. It is shown that distributions of internal strains, areas of strain concentrations, locations of damage initiation, and processes of damage growth can be experimentally observed and quantified with good accuracy. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2015.","Composite; Crack; Damage; DIC; Repair","Carbon; Carbon fibers; Composite materials; Cracks; Hybrid materials; Laminated composites; Repair; Strain; Strain measurement; Structure (composition); Analysis of local stress; D. digital image correlation (DIC); Damage; Damage initiation and growths; Digital image correlations; Experimental approaches; Geometrical configurations; Laminated carbon fibers; Image analysis","M.R.

It specifically addresses structural response of aircraft fuselage components made from Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastics (CFRP). The proposed method considers structural modelling requirements necessary for structural optimisation with respect to system response under simultaneous static and dynamic loads. The standard explicit Finite Element (FE) solver LS-Dyna is utilised, providing the framework to regard statics and dynamics as well as non-linearities by material, large deformation and contact. The simplified model is fundamentally composed of shell, beam, and discrete elements. Simulating the structural collapse behaviour of thin-walled CFRP sections under bending load the detailed model provides input parameters for the discrete elements. Furthermore, skinframe- interaction attributes immanent to the present fuselage configuration are reviewed and considered by idealised deformation characteristics. Finally, the present approach is verified through analyses of the detailed model. The results illustrate the benefits of model simplification. Replacing detailed shell model features by beam and non-linear spring elements significantly reduces computational effort. At the same time the accuracy deduction is acceptable considering topological optimisation requirements. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, London, UK.","","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Deformation; Dynamic loads; Structural design; Carbon fibre reinforced plastic (CFRP); Deformation Characteristics; Explicit finite elements; Simplified modelling; Static and dynamic loads; Static and dynamic optimization; Statics and dynamics; Structural optimisation; Fuselages","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84888994948"

In this study, macroporous catalytic carbon nanotemplates (MC-CNTs) based on nanoweb-structured carbon nanofibers with various carbon microstructures are prepared from microbe-derived cellulose via simple heating at 800 or 2400 °C. MC-CNTs prepared at 800 °C have amorphous carbon structures with numerous topological defects, and exhibit a lower voltage overpotential of ≈8 mV in galvanostatic charge/discharge testing. In addition, MC-CNT-800s exhibit high Coulombic efficiencies of 99.4–99.9% during consecutive cycling at current densities ranging from 0.2 to 4 mA cm−2. However, the carbon structures of MC-CNTs prepared at 800 °C are gradually damaged by cycling. This results in significant capacity losses after about 200 cycles. In contrast, MC-CNTs prepared at 2400 °C exhibit well-developed graphitic structures, and maintain predominantly stable cycling behaviors over 1000 cycles with Coulombic efficiencies of ≈99.9%.

The single-piece, all Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) X-Brace, an important structural component of the body system, was developed from lightweight carbon fiber material to maximize weight reduction and meet performance targets. The development process was driven extensively by virtual engineering, which applied CAE analysis and results to drive the design and improve the design efficiency. Topology optimization and section optimization were used to generate the initial design's shape, form and profile, while respecting the package requirements of the engine compartment. Concept selection, geometry sensitivity studies and concept refinement methods were then used to optimize the design, considering manufacturing constraints and all critical load cases.

Because the transformation only deals with polymerized materials and can be conducted mostly in solid state in the absence of solvents, environmentally friendly and energy saving measures, like self-healing that autonomously repairs damages created during fabrication or usage, have been proposed. In the meantime, many researchers are also devoted to using this feature for solving processing problems of crosslinked polymers. It not only breaks through the strict limits of traditional thermoplastic and thermosetting polymers, but also brings in new methods and new functionalities. As a result, material diversification with extended life cycles becomes available. A series of novel prototype techniques specified for the crosslinked polymers containing reversible covalent bonds are developed accordingly, which include mechanical properties regulation, plastic deformation, welding, dispersion of nano-fillers and their reinforcement effect, compression molding, injection molding, extrusion molding, 3D printing, controllable degradation and reprocessing of carbon fibre reinforced composites. Quite a few engineering processes that cannot be realized by means of existing industrial methods come true. Clearly, the research achievements in this area represent possible advancement of classic polymer engineering. In this review, basis of reversible covalent chemistry and rheology of reversible covalent polymer are comprehensively elucidated and analysed, followed by summarizing the applications of above prototype techniques on the basis of the types of the reversible reactions involved (i.e. general reversible reactions and dynamic reversible reactions). Moreover, the challenges and development trend of this emerging field are also outlined. On the whole, the innovative knowledge paths are managed to be introduced in a systematic way. It is hoped that more and more scientists will be attracted and join in this promising research. © 2018 Science Press.

Exemplarily, one application is the illumination issue of wind turbines located on different terrains, such as hills in the context of potential bearing errors of the VHF omnidirectional radio range (VOR) due to multipath propagation. Preferably, due to the flexibility of measurements, such investigations are conducted in a scaled environment where object's dimensions are decreased by the same factor the frequencies are increased.

Given that many FFF filament suppliers now offer carbon-fiber filled products, a unique opportunity emerges in the design of polymer composite FFF parts since bead and fiber direction can potentially be prescribed to give the best structural performance. As FFF moves from a technology for rapid prototyping and the hobbyist to a viable additive manufacturing method, it is important to also have a design tool that takes advantage of the opportunities that present themselves when polymer composites are employed. This paper presents a topology optimization method for continuous fiber angle optimization approach (CFAO), which computes optimal material distribution (as in the well known SIMP method) in addition to a preferred fiber angle direction by minimizing compliance of statically loaded structures. Our computed results show the effects of variable orientation angle on fiber reinforced microstructure for the topology of two-dimensional FFF parts. Optimal fiber orientations are shown to align with the axis of structural members that form within the structure as expected. Example design problems are solved and then printed on desktop 3D FFF printers using the material distribution results and a simple infill method which approximates the optimal fiber angle results by a contour-parallel deposition strategy. Mechanical stiffness testing of the printed parts show improved results as compared to structures designed without accounting for the direction of the composite structure. Future work includes extension of the method to three dimensional structures for further application. © 2016 The Department of Energy’s Kansas City National Security Campus is operated and managed by Honeywell Federal Manufacturing Technologies, LLC under contract number DE-NA0002839.","","3D printers; Additives; Carbon fibers; Filled polymers; Product design; Reinforcement; Topology; Material distribution; Mechanical stiffness; Optimization approach; Short carbon fibers; Structural performance; Three-dimensional structure; Topology Optimization Method; Variable orientation; Fabrication","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85035031841"

Sandwich panels with a fixed CFRP truss mass have been fabricated using a variety of closed cell polymer and syntactic foams, resulting in core densities ranging from 44-482kgm-3. The through thickness and in-plane shear modulus and strength of the cores increased with increasing foam density. The use of low compressive strength foams within the core was found to result in a significant reduction in the compressive strength contributed by the CFRP trusses. X-ray tomography led to the discovery that the trusses develop an elliptical cross-section shape during pressure assisted resin transfer. The ellipticity of the truss cross-sections increased, and the lattice contribution to the core strength decreased as the foam density was reduced. Micromechanical modeling was used to investigate the relationships between the mechanical properties and volume fractions of the core materials and truss topology of the hybrid core. The specific strength and moduli of the hybrid cores lay between those of the CFRP lattices and foams used to fabricate them. However, their volumetric and gravimetric energy absorptions significantly exceeded those of the materials from which they were fabricated.

In this study, FeCl3·6H2O/urea composite deep eutectic catholyte (FeU-DEC)-infused self-standing carbon nanofiber (CNF) was synthesized for green and high power density RFB through industrially available processes. FeU-DEC-infused CNF displayed an extremely high power density (874 mW/g) as well as high capacity (27.28 mAh/g) derived from high theoretical capacity of FeU-DEC (89.24 mAh/g) in addition to the advantages of the FeU-DEC characteristics (e.g., nonflammable, biodegradable, facile preparation). This is because of the large electroactive area derived from the high surface area of CNF and superlyophilicity of FeU-DEC on CNFs. Furthermore, we compared the wettability of CNF with other electrodes, as well as the chemical stability and electrode performance, based on topological wetting analysis using parameters of fiber radius, fiber interval, the equilibrium contact angle of FeU-DEC on electrodes, and surface tension of FeU-DEC, giving wetting threshold for FeU-DEC on fibrous electrodes. The wetting analysis are applied not only for FeU-DEC, but also for a wide range of other DECs and deep eutectic anolyte.

Unlike 2D laminated composites which exhibit catastrophic failure typically through delamination, 3D woven composites exhibit a progressive damage behavior that leads to high specific energy absorption (SEA). Thus, enabling the manufacture of reduced weight structural components for energy absorption compared to traditional materials such as laminated composites or high strength metals. This is of particular importance for automotive applications, where weight reduction is sought through material change in vehicle components that play a critical role in crashworthiness. The rate dependent nature of these materials, however, is not well understood. The goal of this study was to experimentally compare the SEA of various 3D woven and 2D laminated composites manufactured with identical carbon fiber and resin that were tested under quasi-static and various dynamic crushing loads. In general, 3D woven composites were found to have higher SEA measures than 2D laminates, and orthogonal fiber topologies were found to have higher values than ply-to-ply interlocking configurations. All specimens tested displayed substantially reduced SEA for higher velocity impacts. Micro-computed tomography scans of tested samples were used to gain insight into energy absorption mechanisms in 3D woven composites. Finally, resin toughening was found to have a significant impact on SEA performance. © Copyright 2017.

Recent advances in topology optimization and bioinspiration have brought interesting answers to this question, but they provide only small windows into the vast design space associated with this problem. Here, we take a more global approach in which we assess the mechanical performance of thousands of possible microstructures. This exhaustive exploration gives a global picture of structure-property relationships and guarantees that global optima can be found. Landscapes of optimum solutions for different combinations of desired properties can also be created, revealing the robustness of each of the solutions. Interestingly, while some of the major hybrid designs used in engineering are absent from the set of solutions, the microstructures emerging from this process are reminiscent of materials, such as bone, nacre or spider silk. © 2013 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

In the automotive industry, one of the ways to achieve that is a reduction of the support structure weight. The solution that was derived from aerospace industry is monocoque support structure. Nevertheless, proper design of such structure is challenging, expensive, especially in unit production and hard to repair or modify in case of new subassemblies. An alternative solution for vehicle lightweight support structure is spatial frame created from carbon fibre reinforced composite tubes. A problem of such structure, in case of laminate composite materials, are the tubes connections. In classical aluminium spatial frame connections are welded, and therefore their strength is close to the material strength. In case of carbon fibre, such connections are usually created using adhesives, connecting carbon fibre reinforced tubes with composite shaped connectors or by precise cutting of the ends of tubes in order to increase area of contact between interfaces, applying adhesive and bounding tubes using composite materials. Another considered solution is carbon fibre tubes reinforced with 3D printed ribbing. Both analysis and optimization were conducted using HyperWorks software. The paper presents a novel approach to composite structures connectors optimization. © 2018 The authors and IOS Press.","Carbon fibre reinforced joints; HyperWorks; Spatial frame; Topology optimization","3D printers; Adhesives; Aerospace industry; Automotive industry; Carbon fibers; Energy absorption; Glass ceramics; Reinforcement; Tubes (components); Carbon fiber reinforced; Carbon fiber reinforced joint; Composites material; Design and optimization; Hyperwork; Optimisations; Reinforced joints; Spatial frames; Support structures; Topology optimisation; Laminated composites","M.

This laser has been progressing tremendously with new pulse regimes and incorporating novel devices inside its cavity. Recently, a nanomaterial based saturable absorber (SA) was used in ultrafast laser that has improved the lasing performance and caused a reduction in the physical dimension when compared to conventional SAs. To date, the nanomaterials that are exploited for the development of SA devices are carbon nanotubes, graphene, topological insulators, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and black phosphorous. These materials have unique advantages such as high nonlinear optical response, fiber compatibility and ease of fabrication. In these, TMDs are prominent and an emerging two-dimensional nanomaterial for photonics and optoelectronics applications.

Welding was done using ytterbium fibre laser by considering laser power, weld speed and distance of the focal point from the sample surface as the input parameters. Microscopy was used to measure the weld dimensions. Micro-indentation was made to measure the corresponding Vickers hardness along the horizontal cross section. Two different models were developed. The first model had mean hardness and weld-bead geometry represented by four geometrical dimensions of the weld (that is, top width, depth, mid-width and heat-affected-zone width at mid-depth) as the modelling outputs. The second model had the hardness profile plot interpolation parameters as the modelling outputs. Two different designs of neural networks were used for process-based modelling, namely counter-propagation neural network (CPNN) and feed-forward back-propagation neural network (BPNN), and their prediction capabilities were compared. For the feed-forward neural network, a genetic algorithm was later applied to enhance the prediction accuracy by altering its topology. Back-propagation was implemented using 12 different training algorithms.

The far-infrared to submillimeter domain is a unique probe of the cold and obscured Universe, harboring for instance the precious signatures of key elements such as water. Space observations are mandatory given the blocking effect of our atmosphere. However the methods we have relied on so far to develop increasingly larger telescopes are now reaching a hard limit, with the JWST illustrating this in more than one way (e.g. it will be launched by one of the most powerful rocket, it requires the largest existing facility on Earth to be qualified). With the Thinned Aperture Light Collector (TALC) project, a concept of a deployable 20 m annular telescope, we propose to break out of this deadlock by developing novel technologies for space telescopes, which are disruptive in three aspects: â An innovative deployable mirror whose topology, based on stacking rather than folding, leads to an optimum ratio of collecting area over volume, and creates a telescope with an eight times larger collecting area and three times higher angular resolution compared to JWST from the same pre-deployed volume; â An ultra-light weight segmented primary mirror, based on electrodeposited Nickel, Composite and Honeycomb stacks, built with a replica process to control costs and mitigate the industrial risks; â An active optics control layer based on piezo-electric layers incorporated into the mirror rear shell allowing control of the shape by internal stress rather than by reaction on a structure. We present in this paper the roadmap we have built to bring these three disruptive technologies to technology readiness level 3. We will achieve this goal through design and realization of representative elements: segments of mirrors for optical quality verification, active optics implemented on representative mirror stacks to characterize the shape correction capabilities, and mechanical models for validation of the deployment concept. Accompanying these developments, a strong system activity will ensure that the ultimate goal of having an integrated system can be met, especially in terms of (a) scalability toward a larger structure, and (b) verification philosophy. © 2016 SPIE.","Active optics; Actorics; Automation; Carbon composite structures; Carbon fibre; Deployable telescope systems; Far-infrared space astronomy; Lightweight mirrors","Automation; Carbon carbon composites; Carbon fibers; Light; Millimeter waves; Rockets; Space telescopes; Talc; Active Optics; Actorics; Carbon composites; Deployable telescopes; Far infrared; Lightweight mirrors; Mirrors","M.

On the basis of the space layout of optical elements in a coaxil three-mirror optical system and the technological properties and attributes of the Carbon Fiber Reinfored Plastic(CFRP), the main backbone of the camera was designed and manufactured with CRFP and titanium by this method. First, the core body of main backbone was made up of CFRP, and the gridding and thickness were optimized with topology analysis. Then, the metal embedded parts were arranged according to an optical lens, every metal embedded parts were lightweighted and the mode and the deformation of the main backbone were analyzed. Finally, the results of design and analysis were verified by a vibration test. The experiment and test indicate that the CFRP main backbone is 15.6 kg, the circumscribed circle diameter is Φ870 mm, and the height is 130 mm. Furthermore, the average density and the first mode frequency are 0.313 g/cm2 and 479.2 Hz, respectively.

Sandwich panels with carbon fiber composite truss volumes of 1.5-17.5% of the core volume have been fabricated, and the through-thickness compressive strength and modulus measured, and compared with micromechanical models that establish the relationships between the mechanical properties of the core, its topology and the mechanical properties of the truss and foam. The through thickness modulus and strength of the hybrid cores is found to increase with increasing truss core volume fraction. However, the lattice strength saturates at high CFRP truss volume fraction as the proportion of the truss material contained in the nodes increases.

This ultraweakly interacting structure can enhance the thermal damage threshold and decrease the accumulated nonlinearity, which is proved to be an excellent choice for high-power mode-locked laser.

The compensation of the thermal expansion of metal by the thermal contraction of carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs), which has a negative linear expansion coefficient, lies behind this method. The metal structure is bonded with CFRP bandage and thermoelectric modules to achieve the temperature difference between the metal and the CFRP, thereby realizing the same thermal deformation. The heat transfer channel in the compensation system for thermal deformation is designed by the structural topology design method to distribute the heat evenly. Experimental and numerical simulation results show that the suggested approach reduces thermal displacement by 93% compared with the metal structure without the CFRP bandage. The suggested method can be applied to thermal deformation compensation for various high-precision equipment, including coordinate measuring machines, aerospace equipment, and optics and optical instruments. © 2018, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","CFRP; Heat transfer channel layout optimization; High-precision machine tool; Thermal deformation balance principle; Thermal error compensation system","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Deformation; Fiber reinforced plastics; Heat transfer; Heating equipment; Machine tools; Metals; Precision engineering; Thermal expansion; Thermoelectricity; Balance principle; Heat transfer channel; High-precision; Linear expansion coefficient; Temperature differences; Thermal deformation compensation; Thermal error compensation; Thermo-electric modules; Error compensation","X.

Unlike previous Q-switched laser demonstrations based on nanosheet-based TIs, which require complicated and sophisticated fabrication procedures, a ∼9.1 μm-thick bulk-structured Bi2Te3 TI film that was prepared using a mechanical exfoliation method was chosen to be used in this experimental demonstration due to ease of fabrication. The modulation depth of our prepared bulk-structured Bi 2Te3 TI-deposited side-polished fiber was measured to be ∼2.5% at 1.06 μm. By incorporating such an absorber in an all-fiberized ytterbium-doped fiber ring cavity, stable Q-switched pulses were obtained through evanescent field interaction between the oscillated beam and the Bi 2Te3 TI film. The temporal width and repetition rate of the output pulses were tunable from ∼1 to ∼1.3 μs and from ∼77 to ∼35 kHz, respectively, depending on the pump power. Through a performance comparison of our laser with recently demonstrated Q-switched 1 μm fiber lasers using carbon nanotubes, graphene, and nano-structured TIs, our bulk-structured Bi 2Te3 TI-based saturable absorber is shown to have passive Q-switching performance comparable to saturable absorbers based on carbon nanotubes or nano-structured TIs. © 2014 IOP Publishing Ltd.","bulk-structured; fiber laser; Q-switched; saturable absorber; topological insulator","Carbon nanotubes; Electric insulators; Evanescent fields; Fiber lasers; Fibers; Film preparation; Optical pumping; Pulse repetition rate; Q switched lasers; Q switching; Saturable absorbers; Semiconductor quantum wells; Topological insulators; bulk-structured; Experimental demonstrations; Fabrication procedure; Mechanical exfoliation; Passively Q-switched; Performance comparison; Q-switched; Ytterbium doped fibers; Bismuth compounds","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84929662103"

Hierarchical CPL cores were evaluated based on their failure mechanism maps, and the structural efficiency was affected by the ratio of strut length at different scales (e.g. L/l1). With the specific limited L/l1, the optimized hierarchical CPL core was almost 5 times stronger than lower-order CPL cores with rectangular trusses (at relative density 0.01).

Among these, tissue engineering is particularly relevant to this technology since electrospun fibers offer topological structure features similar to the native extracellular matrix, thus providing an excellent environment for the growth of cells and tissues. Recently, nanocarbons have been emerging as promising fillers for biopolymeric nanofibrous scaffolds. In fact, they offer interesting physicochemical properties due to their small size, large surface area, high electrical conductivity and ability to interface/interact with the cells/tissues. Nevertheless, their biocompatibility is currently under debate and strictly correlated to their surface characteristics, in terms of chemical composition, hydrophilicity and roughness. Among the several nanofibrous scaffolds prepared by electrospinning, biopolymer/nanocarbons systems exhibit huge potential applications, since they combine the features of the matrix with those determined by the nanocarbons, such as conductivity and improved bioactivity. Furthermore, combining nanocarbons and electrospinning allows designing structures with engineered patterns at both nano- and microscale level. This article presents a comprehensive review of various types of electrospun polymer-nanocarbon currently used for tissue engineering applications. Furthermore, the differences among graphene, carbon nanotubes, nanodiamonds and fullerenes and their effect on the ultimate properties of the polymer-based nanofibrous scaffolds is elucidated and critically reviewed. © 2017 by the authors.

It is widely known that, in recent VRFB systems, one of the key factors in boosting charging or discharging efficiency is the design of the flow field around carbon fiber electrodes and in flow channels. In this study, topology optimization is applied in order to achieve optimized flow field designs. The optimization problem is formulated as a maximization problem for the generation rate of the vanadium species governed by a simplified electrochemical reaction model. A typical porous model is incorporated into the optimization problem for expressing the carbon fiber electrode; furthermore, a mass transfer coefficient that depends on local velocity is introduced. We investigate the dependencies of the optimized configuration with respect to the porosity of the porous electrode and the pressure loss. Results indicate that patterns of interdigitated flow fields are valid designs for VRFBs. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Interdigitated flow field; Local mass transfer coefficient; Porous model; Topology optimization; Vanadium redox flow battery","Carbon fibers; Electric batteries; Electrodes; Energy resources; Flow batteries; Flow fields; Mass transfer; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Secondary batteries; Shape optimization; Vanadium; Wind power; Carbon fiber electrodes; Electrochemical reactions; Interdigitated flow field; Large-scale storage systems; Local mass transfer coefficients; Optimized configuration; Porous model; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Topology","K.

Numerous efforts have, however, led to CNT fibers with maximum strengths of only a few GPa. Here we report that, due to different mechanical responses to the tensile loading of disclination topological defects in the CNT walls, a few of these topological defects are able to greatly decrease the strength of the CNTs, by up to an order of magnitude. This study reveals that even nearly perfect CNTs cannot be used to build exceptionally strong materials, and therefore synthesizing flawless CNTs is essential for utilizing the ideal strength of CNTs. © 2016 American Chemical Society.","carbon nanotubes; density functional tight binding; disclination topological defects; tensile strength","Defects; Nanotubes; Tensile strength; Topology; Yarn; Density functional tight bindings; Disclinations; Ideal strength; Maximum strength; Mechanical performance; Mechanical response; Tensile loading; Topological defect; Carbon nanotubes","J.

In the composite frame structure, the fiber winding angle at the micro-material scale and the geometrical parameter of components of the frame in the macro-structural scale are introduced as the independent variables on the two geometrical scales. Considering manufacturing requirements, discrete fiber winding angles are specified for the micro design variable. The improved Heaviside penalization discrete material optimization interpolation scheme has been applied to achieve the discrete optimization design of the fiber winding angle. An optimization model based on the minimum structural compliance and the specified fiber material volume constraint has been established. The sensitivity information about the two geometrical scales design variables are also deduced considering the characteristics of discrete fiber winding angles. The optimization results of the fiber winding angle or the macro structural topology on the two single geometrical scales, together with the concurrent two-scale optimization, is separately studied and compared in the paper. Numerical examples in the paper show that the concurrent multi-scale optimization can further explore the coupling effect between the macro-structure and micro-material of the composite to achieve an ultra-light design of the composite frame structure. The novel two geometrical scales optimization model provides a new opportunity for the design of composite structure in aerospace and other industries.

These programmed sandwich structures contain 3D printed core materials with truss, conventional honeycomb, and re-entrant honeycomb topologies. Three-point bending tests are performed to investigate the bending behavior of these sandwich composites with two types of carbon fiber reinforced polymer face sheets. Under bending deformation, sandwich composites with truss core materials provide highest flexural stiffness and strength that are desirable in structural components. The sandwich composites with re-entrant honeycomb core exhibit a sequential snap-through instability which significantly enhances the energy absorption abilities. Our experimental and numerical results indicate that architected core structures can be utilized to tailor the bending properties as well as failure mechanisms.

In this study, the development of intimate contact between carbon fiber reinforced Polyamide-6 (PA-6) tapes is investigated experimentally using consolidation experiments and X-ray computed tomography for quantitative contact characterization. The experimental results indicate that the development of intimate contact occurs in the range of seconds even when temperatures are only slightly above the melting temperature and applied pressures is in the range of 1-4 kPa. Experimental data are compared with the results of the two analytical models proposed by Lee and Springer as well as Yang and Pitchumani. Both models overestimate the time needed to reach full contact for the PA-6 tape. In comparison to previously investigated PEEK materials, PA-6 has a relatively low viscosity and the tapes possess a resin-rich layer near the surface, which seems to influence the contact development process. Besides the assumptions made for viscosity, the sensitivity to input parameters describing the surface topology strongly influence the model results and the accuracy of predictions. © The Author(s) 2017.","carbon fiber reinforced Polyamide-6; consolidation; contact development; fusion bonding; Intimate contact","Computerized tomography; Consolidation; Fibers; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Tapes; Thermoplastics; Topology; Viscosity; Applied pressure; Carbon fiber reinforced; Development process; Fusion bonding; Input parameter; Polyamide 6; Surface topology; X-ray computed tomography; Fiber bonding","T.

The structure was designed and analyzed using Computer Aided Design (CAD) and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE) tools. A space frame design concept was proposed based on the topology optimization results. Carbon composite material was used for light weight structure design. Three-step design optimization process was proposed to use for the detailed composite vehicle structure design with the consideration of manufacturing constraints. The thickness, fiber orientation and stack sequence were obtained through the optimization process. Manufacturing constraints could be imposed to the optimization process in order to obtain a practical design that could be manufactured. A design with total structure weight of 296.7 kg was obtained.

A novel free-hanging 3D printing method was firstly presented by the authors to manufacture CFRTP lattice truss core structures. The free-hanging printing path generation strategy was established to realize the undercut and overhanging truss structure without any support. Based on the free-hanging 3D printing method, the typical lattice topologies and more complex structures like the integral variable-thickness wing were printed. The cross sectional morphology of samples printed by using the free-hanging printing method were analyzed. The investigations on the parameters such as relative density, fiber volume content and truss angle were conducted to reveal the relationship between the process parameters and out-of-plane compressive properties. The experiment results demonstrated that the average structural error was about 1.89% compared with the theoretical geometry. The compression strength of the printed sample was 224% higher than that of the pure thermoplastic resin counterpart. The specific compressive strength of free-hanging printed samples was in competitive status compared with currently existed CFRTP lattice structures in available literatures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Continuous carbon fiber; Free-hanging 3D printing; Lattice truss core; Thermoplastic composites","Compressive strength; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Plastics; Printing; Reinforced plastics; Reinforcement; Sandwich structures; Thermoplastics; Trusses; 3-D printing; Carbon fiber reinforced; Compression strength; Compressive properties; Cross-sectional morphology; Fiber volume content; Lattice truss cores; Thermoplastic composite; 3D printers","Y.

The interface data exchange method is based on radial basis function and the moving mesh generation method is based on infinite interpolation. The flexible flapping wings we investigated are constructed of a carbon fiber skeleton and a thin extensible membrane in a bird like scale with the chord Re of 5e4. This research focused on the influence of different flexibilities with same wing structure topology. The flexibility is controlled by diameters of carbon fiber skeleton and five structures are analyzed. The simulation results proved that the structural deformation has a significant effect on the aerodynamic force, especially on the thrust. A wing with maximum rigidity has the best lift performance but the worst thrust performance, and vice versa. A wing with medium rigidity gets better performance in both lift and thrust. According to the results, it is necessary to balance the relations between structure flexibility and aerodynamic performance. Meantime, the characteristics of different structures are consistent with the variety of attack angle and flapping frequency. © 2015 The Authors.","aerodynamic performance; Flapping wing; flexible; fluid-structure coupling; numerical simulation","Aerodynamics; Carbon fibers; Computer simulation; Electronic data interchange; Flexible wings; Fluid structure interaction; Lift; Mesh generation; Musculoskeletal system; Numerical methods; Numerical models; Radial basis function networks; Rigid wings; Rigidity; Structural dynamics; Wings; Aero-dynamic performance; Flapping wing; flexible; Flexible flapping wings; Fluid structure couplings; Moving mesh generation; Radial basis functions; Structural deformation; Navier Stokes equations","Y.

The complex crack propagation and evolution will be described and compared. Also the influence of the matrix material on the fracture behaviour will be discussed. The fracture behaviour will be analysed using in-situ computed tomography with combined acoustic emission analysis. The load is applied with a specifically designed mechanical load stage with digital force and elongation measurement. Attached to the load stage is an acoustic waveguide which allows an undisturbed acoustic transmission path from the specimen to a broadband flat response acoustic emission sensor. The load is applied incrementally using load-hold cycles at multiple load levels to failure. During the hold period a computed tomography scan of the loaded specimen with a resolution of 1.7 μm is performed. We compare the stress-strain behaviour, the evolution of cracks and the acoustic emission release for thermoplastic and thermoset based carbon composites. Differences in the topology of the 3D crack surfaces and the influence of matrix system ductility will be discussed. Ultimately these investigations help to understand the differences in the failure mechanisms due to the ductility of the matrix material and provide a sophisticated basis for the development of more accurate failure models. © 2016, European Conference on Composite Materials, ECCM.

The suggested new seat frame was composed of two parts, namely the carbon fiber laminate and short carbon fiber stiffener. In order to improve the stiffness and stability of the seat frame, the topology optimization method was used to arrange the layout of the stiffeners on the shell of carbon fiber laminate, and then the composite laminate optimization was implemented to improve the overall stiffness of the structure and reduce the weight of the frame.

Box 365, China","With the continuous expansion in the network scale and growing popular Internet applications, the sharply increasing electrical consumption and even carbon dioxide emissions have became bottlenecks of the future network development. Consequently, greening network comes to a very important issue. Foremost, ensuring the scalability and robustness, we divide the network into multiple domains for the distributed routing and management. As these tendencies undergo widespread attentions, providing solutions for multi-domain green networks are of the utmost importance. This paper enables the power conservation in multi-domain IP over WDM networks by means of presenting a power- and port-cost- efficient approach. This approach delves into power-efficient channel provisions of connection demands and an effective integration of the hybrid grooming and the waveband merging. For each intra-domain connection demand, our method executes the intra-domain hybrid grooming within the physical topology and updates the power efficiency of this domain in real-time. For each inter-domain connection demand, through link-cost adjustments, our method first computes the loose route which is the most power-efficient path from the source border node to the destination border node within the logical topology. The link-cost adjustment aims to make the loose route traverse over higher power-efficient domains and logical links. Next, it orderly performs the intra-domain hybrid grooming between two selected border nodes in each traversed domain of this loose route, from the source node to the selected border node in the source domain and from the selected border node to the destination node in the destination domain. In final, within each single domain, our method merges several full-loaded lightpath segments into a single waveband tunnel along with more than two physical hops by the intra-domain waveband merging. The Optical Cross-Connect (OXC) ports are able to be further saved. In comparison to the traditional multi-domain grooming approach, our method exhibits the higher power efficiency and port savings. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Composite materials have been used for IP carrier which forms the skeleton of the cockpit and provides the base architecture off of which IP components are attached and function. Specially, composite materials using injection molding process have been used to develop IP carrier recently, due to high level of styling flexibility by that can achieve high degree integration and simplicity of process. However, for injection part especially for large part would deform largely. Consequently, deformation controlling is very important for large composite part that used injection molding. In this study mold flow analysis was conducted on the composite IP carrier structure which gets from the topology optimization result. The investigation consists of injection method, molding process and the position that would deform largely. The molding process was set and the positions deforming largely were found out. Structural optimization was done to control the deformation within the requirements. Mold flow analysis result for the optimization structure showed that deformation of crucial position were within the requirement. After that, 3D scanning test and composite IP carrier assembling were conducted to verify the CAE simulation result. The simulation result can met with the 3D scanning test result, and the composite IP carrier can be assembled to vehicle successfully.

Thus, it describes the results and the key messages of several IEA-IA-HEV-Task 17 workshops and studies, by focusing on the following topics: E-Motors: This section is focusing on the advantages and disadvantages of Permanent Magnet Motors with rare-earth permanent magnets, representing one of the most common motors being used so far (based on the reporting year 2012). Additionally it focuses on alternatives for permanent magnet motors, which are currently at a few level. Battery Management Systems (BMS): A BMS constantly controls the functionality and charge of the battery cells. Therefore, it is necessary to lengthen battery life. This chapter addresses concerns for current BMS, provides an overview about their basics and highlights the most important BMS-Tasks for High Voltage batteries as well as the demonstration of a Lithium-Ion battery performance and cost model for electrified vehicles. Thermal Management Systems: The optimization of thermal management has become an important business segment, as it is essential for effective operation of electrified vehicles in all climates. The results and outcomes of a study (Argonne National Laboratory) as well as various workshops addressed innovative methods for Thermal Management Systems. The results are described within this chapter and include specific thermal management technologies, explored innovations on components and Phase-Change-Materials. Simulation Tools: For many years now numerical simulation has become an essential tool to engineers in the product development process. Computing methods have been refined to such an extent that today simulations are more and more referred to as a basis for important product decisions. This chapter deals with a few simulation tools in the field of system optimization and vehicle integration, including “Autonomie”, “Cruise” and “Dymola/Modelica”. Functional and Innovative Lightweight Concepts and Materials: In the future, the proportion of high-tensile steels, aluminium and carbon-fibre-reinforced plastics in vehicles is set to increase from 30 % today to up to 70 % in 2030 (McKinsey & Company, Lightweight, heavy impact, 2013). High-tensile steel will remain the most important lightweight material and carbon-fiber-reinforced plastics are expected to experience annual growth of 20 %.As Lightweight construction of the vehicle body has become a very important field of R&D activities, this chapter focus on the outcomes of a study on the impacts of the vehicle’s mass efficiency and fuel consumption (Argonne National Laboratory) as well as on various methods of light weighting a vehicle, like simulation tools, advanced “smart” materials, bionic concepts and functional integration. Power Electronics and future Drive Train Technologies: Around 40 years ago, the first piece of software was used in a vehicle to control the ignition of the engine. Today, up to 90 % of all innovations in a car are realized with electronics and software, based on the customers demand for new safety and convenience functions—Advanced Driver Assistance Systems—which are the basics for autonomous driving. This chapter points out that modular drivetrain topologies are as much important as the requirement of layered, flexible and scalable architectures. The further improvement of the power control unit as well as the E/E-Architecture will play a key role in the future of electrified vehicles. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Battery Pack; Controller Area Network; Drive Cycle; Switch Reluctance Motor; Torque Ripple","","M.

Gill Composites Center, Department of Chemical Engineering and Materials Science, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, 90089, CA, United States","Composite laminates cured out-of-autoclave (OOA) using vacuum-bag-only (VBO) prepregs can sometimes exhibit significant surface porosity on the tool-side surface when using only a liquid release agent. This porosity may be eliminated by using a release film or a resin-rich surfacing ply between the tool and part during cure, or by post-cure operations such as gel-coating and painting. Because such solutions can add significant time and cost to the overall manufacturing process, new strategies to inhibit surface porosity need to be developed. However, the mechanisms of void formation and tool-part interactions that lead to such surface porosity are not fully understood. The following paper presents a parametric study that clarifies the underlying causes of surface porosity in OOA-VBO carbon fiber-epoxy laminates and determines the relative importance of key manufacturing parameters, including tool plate surface topology, release methodology, prepreg material, and room-temperature vacuum hold time. Laminates are manufactured under various conditions using traditional OOA-VBO protocols. Then, optical microscopy and image analysis are used to characterize the surface porosity in terms of pattern and area. Thus, these parameters are related to expected part quality. Copyright 2014.

Despite a regular appearance of downstreaming wave flow in the movies, deeper image analysis shows that the pattern structure is complex. The observed grayscale levels of the flow pattern are likely to correspond to a combination of temperature, topology, and emissivity of the keyhole front, in turn originating from variations of the beam absorption, temperature, boiling, ablation pressure, and melt acceleration across the keyhole surface. Bright domains can fluctuate on a time scale of 10-100 μs. For interpretation of the fundamental mechanisms, the evidence from high speed imaging analysis is accompanied by mathematical modeling of the absorption modulation, combining local absorptivity, and beam projection. The calculated results show that for a wide range of keyhole topology parameters, lasers with a wavelength of about 1 μm induce high absorption peaks at the wave shoulders while CO2-lasers have a more homogenizing behavior. Different regimes can be distinguished. © 2015 Laser Institute of America.","absorption; high speed imaging; keyhole; laser welding; modeling","Absorption; Carbon dioxide lasers; Fiber lasers; Flow patterns; High speed cameras; Laser beam welding; Models; Welding; Ablation pressure; Absorption modulation; Absorption peaks; Fundamental mechanisms; High speed imaging; keyhole; Pattern structure; Topology parameters; Topology","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84943591577"

Carbon fiber reinforced composite and polymer LTRHs were fabricated using different manufacturing approaches. Out-of-plane compression tests were performed on the LTRHs, and the properties were compared with the conventional square honeycombs. The stiffness and strength values of composite LTRHs didn't surpass those of composite square honeycombs due to the manually induced defects. On the other hand, polymeric LTRHs with perfect geometries were stiffer and stronger than the corresponding polymeric square honeycombs. A parametric study of the buckling resistance was carried out via finite element analysis, and the results indicated that hollow lattice stiffens honeycombs and increases the resistance to buckling, while the specific properties of honeytubes depend on their geometrical parameters. Moreover, the crush force efficiency and specific energy absorption were greater than those of square honeycombs and hollow lattice. This work demonstrates that hybrid designs that capitalize on micro-topologies can populate vacant regions in mechanical property charts, and provide increased energy absorption as crushing protection structures. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","3D printing; Composites; Crashworthiness; Honeycombs; Lattice structure","Composites; Energy Consumption; Honeycomb Structures; 3D printers; Carbon; Composite materials; Compression testing; Crashworthiness; Crushing; Energy absorption; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Finite element method; Geometry; Polymers; Reinforcement; Topology; Trusses; 3-D printing; Carbon fiber reinforced composite; Crush force efficiency; Honeycombs; Lattice structures; Out-of-plane compression; Protection structure; Specific energy absorption; Honeycomb structures","J.

In biology, these systems have a direct relation to critical processes ranging from the movement of actin or assembly of viruses at cellular interfaces to the growth of amyloid plaques in neurodegenerative diseases. In technology and applied sciences, synthetic macromolecules or fibrous objects such as carbon nanotubes are involved in countless applications. Accessing their intrinsic properties at the single molecule level, such as their molecular conformations or intrinsic stiffness, is central to the understanding of these systems, their properties, and the design of related applications. In this Perspective we introduce FiberApp - a new tracking and analysis software based on a cascade of algorithms describing structural and topological features of objects characterized by a very high length-to-width aspect ratio, generally described as ""fiber-like objects"". The program operates on images from any microscopic source (atomic force or transmission electron microscopy, optical, fluorescence, confocal, etc.), acquiring the spatial coordinates of objects by a semiautomated tracking procedure based on A∗ pathfinding algorithm followed by the application of active contour models and generating virtually any statistical, topological, and graphical output derivable from these coordinates. Demonstrative features of the software include statistical polymer physics analysis of fiber conformations, height, bond and pair correlation functions, mean-squared end-to-end distance and midpoint displacement, 2D order parameter, excess kurtosis, fractal exponent, height profile and its discrete Fourier transform, orientation, length, height, curvature, and kink angle distributions, providing an unprecedented structural description of filamentous synthetic and biological objects. © 2015 American Chemical Society.","","Application programs; Aspect ratio; Conformations; Discrete Fourier transforms; Fibers; Glycoproteins; Light transmission; Mobile security; Mobile telecommunication systems; Neurodegenerative diseases; Open systems; Polymers; Proteins; Software engineering; Topology; Transmission electron microscopy; Viruses; Yarn; Midpoint displacement; Molecular conformation; Pair correlation functions; Path-finding algorithms; Semi-flexible polymers; Single molecule level; Structural descriptions; Synthetic macromolecules; Open source software","","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84924370659"

A bipolar plate is a multifunctional component that performs various roles in the PEMFC stack. Recently, thin (<200 μm) bipolar plates made from a continuous carbon fiber reinforced composite (CFRP) have been developed to reduce the mass and cost of the PEMFC stacks. The electrical contact resistance (ECR) between the CFRP bipolar plates is much higher than the ECR between the gas diffusion layer (GDL) and bipolar plate. However, until now, only the ECR between the GDL and bipolar plate has been considered the most important technical target. In this study, the ECR between bipolar plates without bulk resistance were measured to present a standard contact resistance value. The ECR of various types of carbon-based materials for bipolar plate was investigated with respect to hardness and resistivity. A mechanical abrasion method using sandpaper was applied to the surface of CFRPs to remove the resin-rich area and control the surface topology. As a result, the ECR between bipolar plates was quantified with respect to the surface hardness, resistivity and roughness, and optimum surface treatment conditions were obtained to minimize the ECR. © 2018","Carbon-based materials; CFRP bipolar plate; Electrical contact resistance; Surface contact model; Surface topology","Contact resistance; Current voltage characteristics; Diffusion in gases; Electric contacts; Electrodes; Fiber reinforced plastics; Fuel cells; Hardness; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Surface treatment; Topology; Bipolar plates; Carbon based materials; Electrical contact resistance; Surface contact model; Surface topology; Surface resistance","D.G.

This factor includes information about surface topology and can be measured easily on field, by techniques such as optical perfilometers. The surface irregularity factor has been correlated with stiffness degradation, which is a well-accepted parameter for the evaluation of the fatigue damage state of composite materials. Constant amplitude fatigue loads (CAL) and realistic variable amplitude loads (VAL), representative of real in- flight conditions, have been applied to ""dog bone"" shaped tensile specimens. It has been shown that the measurement of the surface irregularity parameters can be applied to evaluate the damage state of a structure, and that it is independent of the type of fatigue load that has caused the damage. As a result, this measurement technique is applicable for a wide range of inspections of composite material structures, from pressurized tanks with constant amplitude loads, to variable amplitude loaded aeronautical structures such as wings and empennages, up to automotive and other industrial applications. © 2015 by the authors.","CFRP; Composites materials; Fatigue damage; Irregularity factor; Non-contact inspection; Non-destructive test; Optical inspection; Spectrum fatigue loads","Amplitude modulation; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Composite materials; Inspection; Nondestructive examination; Parameter estimation; Composites material; Irregularity factor; Non-destructive test; Noncontact inspection; Optical inspection; Spectrum fatigue; Fatigue damage","P.

The anisotropy of the homogenized material model results from the homogenization method and from the reformulation of the non-local continuum damage theory to account for the material anisotropy. As a result the damage propagation direction in each ply is predicted with accuracy as compared to the experimental results, while the problems of losing uniqueness and strain localization, which occur in classical finite element simulations when strain softening of materials is involved, can be avoided.To model the delamination process, the hybrid discontinuous Galerkin/extrinsic cohesive law method is introduced at the ply interfaces.

Synthetic wings similar in size to that of a humming bird's were manufactured with the hope of understanding these affects. The experimental method for measuring thrust and the manufacturing process used to make the wings have seen improvement from previous work such that there is less scatter and uncertainty; this allows for smaller variations in thrust to be detected. With confidence in the fabrication and testing procedure, an optimization problem was attempted where three design parameters were chosen as variables and the objective was to maximize thrust. These efforts were coupled with noncontact imaging techniques like digital image correlation and laser doppler velocimetry to help extract the characteristics that are consistent with wings that produce considerable thrust. The results of these tests will help to obtain the relationships between the consciously selected geometric parameters and the thrust produced. It was found that by machining the synthetic wings from acetal resin sheet and pairing that skeleton with a carbon fiber rod less variation was present. This wing construction was found to have a quick production time, making an experimental optimization feasible. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2014.","DIC; Flapping; LDV; MAV; Thrust","Acetal resins; Aspect ratio; Carbon fibers; Geometrical optics; Infrared imaging; Inverse problems; Micro air vehicle (MAV); Optimization; Wings; DIC; Flapping; LDV; MAV; Thrust; Automobile manufacture","K.

The integrated design method of a CFRP seat backrest will be studied and verified numerically. On the condition that the unchangeable seat dimensions and previous mounting positions on the floor, a three-dimensional CAD conceptual model in which the design and non-design domains were separated was established firstly, and then, the optimal material distribution in the design domain was determined by topology optimization technology according to the ECE (European Union standards) test standard. Next, the positions of ribs are determined and the manufacturing feasibility was verified numerically. Finally, the finite element model of the CFRP seat backrest was established, and static bending stiffness and crashworthiness were analyzed and the simulation results were compared with the previous allsteel structure. It is demonstrated that a 20.4% weight reduction is achieved, and previous 26 steel components could be replaced by only one CFRP component and no additional assembly is required.

The use of cognitive MUAV swarms for distributing mobile sensors is a significant value add for chemical plume detection in rescue missions and also in particular for remote sensing and surveillance purposes [1][2]. The objective of our proposed cognitive and sensor aided mesh network is to maximize the spatial sensing coverage on the one hand and the connectivity between the cooperative MUAVs on the other. Next to these contrary optimization goals we developed bioinspired algorithms seeking concurrently for a global target and a coherent topology of the swarm in order to avoid self-separations. In this paper we particularly focus on an agent-based methodology for communication aware mobility behavior of self-organizing MUAVs at high vehicular speeds which provoke fast topology changes and lead to a transient aerial mesh network. To determine the key figures of the system, the performance of dynamically adapted mobility algorithms is analyzed and compared under lognormal channel conditions. © 2010 IEEE.","","Algorithms; Carbon Fibers; Communication; Lithium; Optimization; Remote Sensing; Telecommunications; Vehicles; Algorithms; Chemical detection; Communication systems; Fiber reinforced materials; Global system for mobile communications; Lithium; Remote sensing; Topology; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Wireless telecommunication systems; Agent-based methodologies; Bio-inspired algorithms; Channel aware; Chemical plumes; Lithium polymer batteries; Lognormal channels; Low altitudes; Mesh network; Mobile sensors; Mobility behavior; Optimization goals; Rescue missions; Self organizing; Self-organizing wireless; Sensing coverage; Value add; Vehicular speed; Carbon fibers","K.

Detailed destructive examination of specimens suggested that much of the work of fracture arose when the specimens were strained well beyond the failure of individual tows yet still carried loads ∼1 GPa. A mechanism of lockup amongst broken tows sliding across the final tensile fracture surface was suggested as the means by which high loads could still be transferred after tow failure. In this paper, the roles of weave architecture and the distribution of flaws in the mechanics of tow lockup are investigated by Monte Carlo simulations using the so-called Binary Model. The Binary Model was introduced previously as a finite element formulation specialised to the problem of simulating relatively large, three-dimensional segments of textile composites, without any assumption of periodicity or other symmetry, while preserving the architecture and topology of the tow arrangement. The simulations succeed in reproducing all qualitative aspects of measured stress-strain curves. They reveal that lockup can indeed account for high loads being sustained beyond tow failure, provided flaws in tows have certain spatial distributions. The importance of the interlock architecture in enhancing friction by holding asperities on sliding fibre tows into firm contact is highlighted. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Although the lithiation behavior of silicon and carbon as individual components has been well understood, lithium ion transport behavior across a network of silicon and carbon is still lacking. In this paper, we probe the lithiation behavior of silicon nanoparticles attached to and embedded in a carbon nanofiber using in situ TEM and continuum mechanical calculation. We found that aggregated silicon nanoparticles show contact flattening upon initial lithiation, which is characteristically analogous to the classic sintering of powder particles by a neck-growth mechanism. As compared with the surface-attached silicon particles, particles embedded in the carbon matrix show delayed lithiation. Depending on the strength of the carbon matrix, lithiation of the embedded silicon nanoparticles can lead to the fracture of the carbon fiber. These observations provide insights on lithium ion transport in the network-structured composite of silicon and carbon and ultimately provide fundamental guidance for mitigating the failure of batteries due to the large volume change of silicon anodes. © 2012 American Chemical Society.","carbon fiber; fracture; in situ TEM; Li-ion battery; lithiation; Si nanoparticle","Absorption; Computer Simulation; Lithium; Microscopy, Electron, Transmission; Models, Chemical; Nanotubes, Carbon; Silicon; Carbon fibers; Continuum mechanics; Electrochemical cells; Fracture; Lithium alloys; Sintering; carbon nanotube; lithium; silicon; A-carbon; Capacity fading; Carbon matrix; Carbon nanocomposite; Contact flattening; In-situ TEM; Individual components; Li-ion batteries; Lithiation; Lithium-ion battery; Lithium-ion transport; Powder particles; Rational design; Si nanoparticles; Silicon anode; Silicon nanoparticles; Silicon particles; Topological features; Volume change; absorption; article; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; isolation and purification; methodology; transmission electron microscopy; Nanoparticles","C.

The interfacial adhesion strength was evaluated in terms of interfacial shear strength (τ), interlaminar shear strength (ILSS) and transverse flexural strength (FS 90°). τ, ILSS and FS 90° increased with the increase in surface oxygen content and surface roughness of carbon fiber. τ and ILSS which are related to longitudinal shear strength, had a good first-order correlation. However, FS 90° which is related to transverse adhesion strength, did not correlated with τ. The shear strength may depend on the friction coefficient. The surface roughness of the carbon fiber was considered to increase the roughness component of the friction coefficient. FS 90° relied on the process of destruction. It was considered that crack propagation was stopped by the surface roughness and the rise in the resistance of crack propagation resulted in the high values of FS 90°. © 1993, The Society of Fiber Science and Technology, Japan.

In this paper we propose a hybrid-power IP over WDM network where renewable energy is used to reduce the CO2 emission of IP overWDMnetworks. ALinear Programming (LP) model and a novel heuristic are developed to minimize the non-renewable power consumption in the ""hybrid-power"" IP over WDM network. The performance of the network is studied considering two topologies, the NSFNET and the USNET. Compared with routing in the electronic layer, the results show that routing in the optical layer coupled with using renewable energy significantly reduces the CO 2 emissions of the IP over WDM network by up to 73% for the NSFNET and 69% for the USNET, and the proposed heuristic has little impact on the QoS. We also develop an LP model to identify the impact of the location of nodes employing renewable energy on the non-renewable power consumption of the network. The results show that the optimum location of nodes employing renewable energy is determined according to the output power of the renewable energy sources and the power consumption of the nodes. © 2012 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.","","Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Fiber optic networks; Information technology; Renewable energy resources; Telecommunication systems; Wavelength division multiplexing; CO2 emissions; Energy efficient; Global emissions; Information and Communication Technologies; IP over WDM networks; Non-renewable; Optical layers; Optimum location; Output power; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Internet protocols","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860295436"

(1999). Optimal periodic scheduling of multipurpose plants. Computers& Chemical Engineering, 23, 635-655], we propose a continuous time mixed integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the cyclic scheduling of a mixed plant, i.e. a plant composed of batch and continuous tasks. The cycle duration is a variable of the model and the objective is to maximize productivity. By using strengthening techniques and the analysis of small polytopes related to the problem formulation, we strengthen the initial formulation by tightening some initial constraints and by adding valid inequalities. We show that this strengthened formulation is able to solve moderate size problems quicker than the initial one. However, for real size cases, it remains difficult to obtain the optimal solution of the scheduling problem quickly. Therefore, we introduce MILP-based heuristic methods in order to solve these larger instances, and show that they can provide good feasible solutions quickly. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The chemistry of surface is important because it affects the coefficient of friction (COF), release and abrasion resistance. Wrinkle resistance is improved with slippery surfaces. Abrasion resistance is important for only a few materials such as paper and glass. The chemistry of the roller surface affects one other important property, cost. Most roller surfaces are nothing more than the chemistry of the roller body itself. These commonly include aluminum for idler rollers, and steels or cast steels for process rollers. The carbon-fiber idler roller is seen occasionally, though carbon tends to be slippery and has very poor abrasion resistance.","","Abrasion Resistance; Aluminum; Crease Recovery; Friction; Glass; Paper; Rolls; Topochemistry; Aluminum; Friction; Glass; Paper; Surface chemistry; Topology; Wear resistance; Cast steels; Coefficient of friction; Idler roller; Wrinkle resistance; Rollers (machine components)","","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-33645658533"

In this study the surfaces of glass and carbon fiber reinforcements have been functionalized through plasma treatment and the composite resin matrix has been doped by multi-walled carbon nanotubes grown via chemical vapor deposition. The carbon nanotubes were functionalized using a similar plasma process before insertion into the matrix. Processed individual fiber tows are characterized with direct surface topology observations. Mechanical performance of processed individual fiber tows in an epoxy matrix are evaluated in tensile testing experiments to measure fiber and interlayer bond performance. Surface modifications are linked to enhancements or reductions in performance and the most fruitful topologies identified.

Cohesive crack behaviour is assumed for the solid. The solution of the coupled problem is obtained by using the finite element method without using special approximation techniques nor interface elements. Evolution of the process zone results in continuous changes of the domain topology. This is accounted for by updating the boundary geometry and successive remeshing of the domain. Optimality of the shape of the finite elements generated is controlled and the mesh density is adjusted adaptively on the basis of an error estimator. Two numerical applications are presented, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. In the first, comparison is made with a laboratory experiment, whereas the second handles a problem with crack path completely unknown. © 2004 Civil-Comp Ltd. and Elsevier Ltd.

When the concentration of NaOH was increased, the initial cellulose spectrum was replaced successively by that of Na-cellulose I followed by that of Na-cellulose II. In Na-cellulose I, each carbon atom occurred as a singlet, thus implying that one glucosyl moiety was the independent magnetic residue in the structure of this allomorph. In addition, the occurrence of the C6 near 62 ppm is an indication of a gt conformation for the hydroxymethyl group of Na-cellulose I. In Na-cellulose II, the analysis of the resonances of Cl and C6 points toward a structure based on a cellotriosyl moiety as the independent magnetic residue, in agreement with the established X-ray analysis that has shown that for this allomorph, the fiber repeat was also that of a cellotriosyl residue. For Na-cellulose II, the occurrence of the C6 in the 60 ppm region indicates an overall gg conformation for the hydroxymethyl groups. A comparison of the spectra recorded at 268 K and at room temperature confirms the stronger interaction of NaOH with cellulose when the temperature is lowered. In the Q region, corresponding to NaOH concentrations of around 9% and temperatures below 277 K, most of the sample was dissolved and no specific solid-state 13C NMR spectrum could be recorded, except for that of a small fraction of undissolved cellulose I. The same experiment run on a wood pulp sample leads to a new spectrum, with spectral characteristics different from those of Na-cellulose I and Na-cellulose II. This new spectrum is assigned to the Q phase, which appears to result from topological constraints that are present in whole wood pulp fibers but not in microcrystalline cellulose. A spectrum recorded for samples in the Na-cellulose III conditions resembled that of Na-cellulose II but of lower resolution. Similarly, a spectrum of a sample of Na-cellulose IV was identical to that of hydrated cellulose II. These observations have allowed us to propose a simplified phase diagram of the cellulose/NaOH system in terms of temperature and NaOH concentration. This diagram, which is simpler than the one deduced from X-ray analysis, consists of only four different regions partially overlapping. © 2007 American Chemical Society.","","Cotton; MicrOCRystalline Cellulose; Nuclear Magnetic Resonance; Pulps; Sodium Hydroxide; Temperature; X Ray Analysis; Carbon Isotopes; Cellulose; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Sodium Hydroxide; Gossypium hirsutum; Cotton fibers; Microcrystals; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Pulp; Sodium compounds; Solid state reactions; Temperature; X ray analysis; carbon; cellulose; sodium hydroxide; carbon; microcrystalline cellulose; article; atom; carbohydrate analysis; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; chemical interaction; chemical structure; complex formation; concentration response; conformation; crystal structure; hydration; priority journal; room temperature; solid state; spectroscopy; temperature dependence; wood pulp; X ray analysis; chemistry; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Cellotriosy moiety; Independent magnetic residue; Cellulose","L.

Despite the fact that it has been almost ten years since yarns were first drawn, mere are still controversies on the mechanisms and necessary conditions that can produce yarns and sheets drawn from carbon nanotube forests. Moreover, few works have tried to understand at atomistic level the details of yarn drawing mechanisms, and no fully atomistic simulations have been carried out so far on this particular subject. Our preliminary results suggest that only direct van der Waals interactions among large bundles seem not to be enough to explain the yarn drawing process. Bundle interconnectors (such as small bundles connecting large bundles) were observed to play a critical role in our simulations. Depending on the topology of these interconnectors it was possible to observe from the simulations fibers/yarn formation from proposed structural models. These models were built based on structural information inferred from scanning electron microscopy data. © 2012 Materials Research Society.","","Carbon; Forestry; Forests; Graphite; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Yarn; Carbon nanotubes; Forestry; Graphene; Model structures; Molecular dynamics; Scanning electron microscopy; Van der Waals forces; Wool; Atomistic levels; Atomistic molecular dynamics simulations; Atomistic simulations; Classical molecular dynamics; Drawing process; Interconnectors; Nanotube forests; Structural information; Structural models; Van Der Waals interactions; Yarn","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84870342623"

The nucleation and growth mechanisms of graphitic cones have been even more elusive. We investigate the formation of helical conical fibers of boron nitride (BN) and carbon (C) produced in a catalyst-free environment from the solid-state annealing of an amorphous B-C-N compound. Helical conical fibers consist of a single graphene sheet wrapped conically around an axis. We show that the cones grow radially in clusters, with each cluster arising from a common seed. The radial morphology originates from spherulite-like helicoidal polyhedral particles of BN that serve as templates for the BN and C cones. Evidence is presented that the original seed of the BN polyhedral particles is a ∼5 nm fullerene-like shell. We propose an idealized model for the seed structures that consists of multiply twinned hexagonal (h-)BN crystals containing a screw dislocation. This model provides additional insight into the view that conical graphitic structures originate from topological defects in graphene. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","","Amorphous carbon; Boron; Carbon nitride; Catalysts; Graphene; Nanotubes; Nucleation; Screw dislocations; Topology; Boron nitride nanotubes; Catalyst particles; Catalyst-free; Graphene sheets; Graphitic structures; Idealized models; Nucleation and growth; Polyhedral particles; Seed structure; Solid-state annealing; Topological defect; Carbon fibers","L.

The vane material Titanium is replaced by Carbon Fiber composite materials. For the operating speed the baseline maximum strain in the vane is maintained and weight reduction is taken as the objective function. Three phases of optimization are suggested. In the first phase free size optimization is performed on the composite blades to determine the required topology. A layout of composites is then proposed. In the second phase based on free optimization results gauge optimization setup is illustrated for determining the thicknesses. In the third phase Ply-stacking optimization can be performed. By using composite materials substantial savings in the weight can be achieved without affecting the performance of engine blade.

In order to determine the effect of atmospheric pressure plasma treatment on carbon fiber tensile strength and interfacial bonding strength to polyimide, polyacrylonitrile (PAN) based carbon fibers are treated with atmospheric pressure oxygen/helium plasmas for different durations. Tensile strength change of the fiber is studied at different gage lengths before and after the plasma treatment. Interfacial bonding between the carbon fiber and a thermoplastic polyimide matrix is evaluated using a single fiber composite test system. Weibull analysis of the single fiber tensile test data shows no obvious changes in the tensile strength at short gage lengths after plasma treatment while the fiber strength tends to decrease at larger gage lengths. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) show that the plasma treatments roughen the fiber surfaces. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of fiber surface shows a significant increase of oxygen concentration after plasma treatment and the oxygen containing functional groups reach their maximum levels after 32 s treatment time and further increasing treatment time does not achieve a higher level of oxidation. Plasma treatments decrease dynamic water contact angles and increase the surface energy of the carbon fibers as measured by the modified Wilhelmy method. The interfacial shear strength is improved 21% after the atmospheric pressure plasma treatment for 32 s. It is concluded that the increase of oxygen containing functional groups and changing of the surface topology may contribute collectively to the improvement of fiber/resin interfacial adhesion. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Atmospheric pressure plasma; Carbon fibers; Interfacial properties; Polyimide; Surface treatment; Tensile strength","Adhesion; Atmospheric pressure; Atmospherics; Atomic force microscopy; Contact angle; Fibers; Functional groups; Gages; Oxygen; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Plasma applications; Plasma sources; Polyacrylonitriles; Polyimides; Polymer matrix composites; Pressure effects; Scanning electron microscopy; Shear strength; Surface chemistry; Surface treatment; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Atmospheric pressure plasma treatment; Atmospheric pressure plasmas; Fiber strength; Fiber surface; Gage length; Interfacial adhesions; Interfacial bonding; Interfacial bonding strength; Interfacial property; Interfacial shear strength; Oxygen concentrations; Plasma treatment; Single fiber; Single fiber composite; Surface topology; Tensile tests; Test systems; Thermoplastic polyimide; Treatment time; Water contact angle; Weibull analysis; Carbon fibers","Y.

Elimination of such defects removes a small but potentially misleading bimodality from the size histogram of the fiber population.","Fiber misalignment; Fiber-reinforced composites; Sample preparation defects","Carbon fibers; Characterization; Defects; Geometrical optics; Microscopic examination; Optical microscopy; Topology; Automated topological characterization; Fiber misalignment; Large area automated microscopy; Optical micrographs; Sample preparation defects; Fiber reinforced materials","T.D.

Water drops grow on the fibrous carbon surface in the gas flow channel. The drops adhere to the superficial fiber surfaces but exhibit little penetration into the voids between the fibers. The fibrous surfaces are hydrophobic, but there is a substantial threshold force necessary to initiate water drop motion. Once the water drops begin to move, however, the adhesive force decreases and drops move with minimal friction, similar to motion on superhydrophobic materials. We report here studies of water wetting and water drop motion on typical porous carbon materials (carbon paper and carbon cloth) employed in fuel cells. The static coefficient of friction on these textured surfaces is comparable to that for smooth Teflon. But the dynamic coefficient of friction is several orders of magnitude smaller on the textured surfaces than on smooth Teflon. Carbon cloth displays a much smaller static contact angle hysteresis than carbon paper due to its two-scale roughness. The dynamic contact angle hysteresis for carbon paper is greatly reduced compared to the static contact angle hysteresis. Enhanced dynamic hydrophobicity is suggested to result from the extent to which a dynamic contact line can track topological heterogeneities of the liquid/solid interface. © 2011 American Chemical Society.","carbon; carbon fibers; contact angle; contact angle hysteresis; hydrophobic; Teflon; wetting","Carbon; Contact Angle; Electric Contacts; Fuel Cells; Polytetrafluoroethylene; Rolling; Surfaces; Water Repellence; Wetting; Carbon; Carbon fibers; Channel flow; Contact angle; Electric contacts; Fuel cells; Hydrophobicity; Hysteresis; Paper; Polytetrafluoroethylenes; Rolling resistance; Surfaces; Wetting; Adhesive force; Carbon cloths; Carbon paper; contact angle hysteresis; Drop detachment; Dynamic coefficient of frictions; Dynamic contact angle; Dynamic contacts; Fiber surface; Fibrous carbons; Flow channels; Fuel cell electrodes; Gas flow channel; hydrophobic; Liquid water; Liquid/solid interface; Orders of magnitude; Porous carbon electrodes; Porous carbon materials; Static coefficient of frictions; Static contact angle; Superhydrophobic; Textured surface; Threshold force; Water drop; Water wetting; Drops","J.

An analytical sensitivity analysis of the aeroelastic system is used for the gradient-based optimization of aerodynamic objective functions. An explicit penalty is added, as needed, to force the structure to a 0-1 distribution. The dependence of the solution upon initial design, angle of attack, mesh density, and objective function are presented. Deformation and pressure distributions along the wing are studied for various load-augmenting and load-alleviating designs (both baseline and optimized), in order to establish a link between stiffness distribution and aerodynamic performance of membrane micro air vehicle wings.

Taken together, these tests provide an assessment of the potential of this composite topology for use as a lightweight sandwich core. The honeycombs had two relative densities, 0.12 and 0.24, and two material orientations, ±45° and 0/90° with respect to the prismatic, loading direction of the honeycomb. Honeycomb manufacture was by slotting, assembling and bonding together carbon fibre/epoxy woven plies of composite sheets of 2 × 2 twill weave construction. The peak value of wall stress in the honeycombs was about one third that of the parent material, for all strain rates. An elastic finite element analysis was used to trace the source of this knock-down in strength: a stress concentration exists at the root of the slots and leads to premature failure by microbuckling. Shock-wave effects were evident at impact velocities exceeding 50 ms-1 for the honeycomb of relative density 0.12. This was traced to stubbing of the buckled cell walls against the face of the Kolsky bar. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","A. Carbon fibre; A. Honeycomb; B. Impact behaviour; E.

In this paper, the material design problem is formulated in a form of the least square of the difference between the targeted and designed values. By minimizing the objective subject to volume constraints and periodic boundary conditions, an optimal material distribution in base cell can be generated. Different from existing methods, this paper shows how to use the Evolutionary Structural Optimization (ESO) method to design composite material attaining to thermal conductivity defined by the Hashin-Strikman (H-S) bounds. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated through several 2D examples, agreeing well with commonly known benchmarking microstructures.","Evolutionary structural optimization; Inverse homogenization; Microstructural composites; Nonlinear diffusion; Thermal conductivity; Topology optimization","Aerospace applications; Architectural design; Boundary conditions; Boundary value problems; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Computer networks; Curve fitting; Evolutionary algorithms; Growth (materials); Interfaces (materials); Least squares approximations; Lithography; Materials; Materials properties; Materials science; Optimization; Paper; Physical properties; Pigments; Shape optimization; Structural design; Technology; Textile mills; Thermoelectricity; (mapped) least squares; (PL) properties; Base cell; Evolutionary structural optimization (ESO); international conferences; Material designs; Material distributions; Materials science and technology; Micro structural; Periodic boundary conditions (PBC); Volume constraints; Structural optimization","Q.

Lattices with relative densities in the range 10-20% were manufactured and tested in both compression and shear. Because of the very high strength of the TMC monofilaments, the compressive strengths of both topology lattices were dominated by elastic buckling of the constituent struts. However, under shear loading, some of the struts are subjected to tensile stresses and failure is then set by tensile fracture of the monofilaments. Analytical expressions are derived for the elastic moduli and strength of both lattice topologies and the predictions are compared with measurements over the range of relative densities investigated in this study. Excellent agreement between the measurements and predictions is observed. The specific shear strength of the TMC lattices is superior to all other cellular materials investigated to date, including carbon fiber-reinforced polymers (CFRP) honeycombs. Their compressive properties are comparable to CFRP honeycombs. The TMC lattices have a brittle response and undergo catastrophic failure at their peak load. They appear most promising as candidates for the cores in sandwich structures intended for elevated temperature and multifunctional applications where their limited ductility is not a significant constraint. © 2010 Acta Materialia Inc.","Cellular materials; Mechanical properties; Metal-matrix composites (MMCs)","Carbon Fibers; Forecasts; Fracture; Honeycomb Structures; Mechanical Properties; Properties; Shear Strength; Silicon Carbide; Titanium; Carbon fibers; Elastic moduli; Fiber reinforced materials; Forecasting; Fracture; Honeycomb structures; Materials properties; Mechanical properties; Shear strength; Silicon carbide; Struts; Titanium; Topology; Analytical expressions; Carbon fiber-reinforced polymer; Catastrophic failures; Cell size; Cellular material; Cellular materials; Compression and shear; Compressive properties; Elastic buckling; Elevated temperature; High strength; Lattice structures; Lattice topology; Metal matrix composites; Peak load; Relative density; Shear loadings; Shear response; Tensile fractures; Ti-6al-4v; Titanium matrix composites; Metallic matrix composites","H.N.G.

The tensile and bending stiffness constants of ideal multi-walled and single-walled carbon nano-tubes are derived in terms of the known elastic properties of graphite. Tensile strengths are estimated by scaling the 20 GPa tensile strength of Bacon's graphite whiskers. The natural resonance (fundamental vibrational frequency) of a cantilevered single-wall nanotube of length 1 micron is shown to be about 12 MHz. It is suggested that the thermal expansion of carbon nanotubes will be essentially isotropic, which can be contrasted with the strongly anisotropic expansion in ""conventional"" (large diameter) carbon fibers and in graphite. In contrast, the thermal conductivity may be highly anisotropic and (along the long axis) perhaps higher than any other material. A short discussion of topological constraints to surface chemistry in idealized multi-walled nanotubes is presented, and the importance of a strong interface between nano-tube and matrix for formation of high strength nanotube-reinforced composites is highlighted. © 1995.","fiber-reinforced composites; mechanical properties; Nanotubes; natural resonance; stiffness constant; thermal properties","Anisotropy; Elasticity; Fiber reinforced materials; Graphite; Interfaces (materials); Nanostructured materials; Natural frequencies; Stiffness; Tensile strength; Thermal conductivity; Thermal expansion; Topology; Bending stiffness; Isotropy; Surface chemistry; Carbon","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029233544"

The faces are made of glass fiber reinforced epoxy. The core of the panel is made of carbon nanotubes reinforced polymer foam filling a metallic honeycomb. Electromagnetic modeling and experimental characterization of the core showed that the honeycomb, acting as a hexagonal waveguide, improves the absorption properties in the GHz range above the cut-off frequency compared to the composite foam alone. The EM absorption can be tuned by changing the hybrid material properties. The required levels of electrical conductivity are attained owing to the dispersion of low amounts (1-2wt%) of carbon nanotubes inside the polymer matrix. The combination of the foam and a honeycomb architecture contributes to the decrease of the real part of the relative effective permittivity R(εr, eff). Varying the cell shape of the honeycomb changes the frequency range for high absorption. The absorption properties of sandwich panels has been measured from 8 to 40 GHz and succesfully compared to predictions from an analytical model developed for multilayered topologies. Our results show that a careful design of face-sheets allows to preserve and even improve the absorption performances of the hybrid in a dedicated frequency range. © 2012 IEEE.","","Carbon nanotubes; Electric conductivity; Electromagnetic compatibility; Electromagnetic wave absorption; Foams; Glass fibers; Hybrid materials; Sandwich structures; Absorption performance; Absorption property; Cell shapes; Composite foams; Effective permittivity; Electrical conductivity; Electromagnetic modeling; Experimental characterization; Frequency ranges; Glass fiber reinforced polymer; Glass fiber-reinforced epoxy; Honeycomb architecture; Material property; Metallic honeycomb; Multi-layered; Nanocomposite foams; Real part; Reinforced polymers; Sandwich panel; Honeycomb structures","P.

A wavelength demultiplexer (employing an interference filter) is used for distinguishing between the signals from the dust/CO subsystems. A time division multiplexing scheme utilizing a single pulse technique is employed in detecting the dust signals. In the CO subsystem, a switching protocol permits the detection of the optical PCM signals from the sensors. A wind speed/dual direction sensor is spatially multiplexed with the above subsystems. A fiber optic system with eight sensor lines representing the dust/CO subsystems together with a single wind sensor line has been proposed. A laboratory model with four sensor lines has been constructed, and results from preliminary evaluation of the system are given.","","Carbon monoxide; Dust; Fiber optics; Highway systems; Monitoring; Multiplexing; Pulse code modulation; Signal detection; Time division multiplexing; Tunnels; Ventilation; Wind; Interference filters; Wavelength demultiplexers; Optical sensors","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0029514528"

We notice restricted visibility of scattering features within the series of patterns. The reason is violation of local fiber symmetry (LFS) in the irradiated volume elements (voxels). For its theoretical treatment, a set of elementary topologies (tangential grain, radial grain) is introduced. Systematic aberrations (ultrareconstruction, infrareconstruction) generated by tomographic reconstruction of affected series are described. A concept for handling and utilization of these aberrations for nanostructure analysis is devised. Precursors of polymer microfibrillar-reinforced composites (MFC) containing poly(ether)-block-amide (PEBA) and polyethylene terephthalate) (PET) with varying cold-draw ratio are studied. We compare results from a direct analysis of the smeared measured patterns to results obtained after tomographic reconstruction and fathom the power of reconstruction methods.

The main goal of this algorithm is maximum stiffness with as even a distribution of tension as possible throughout the component, which is achieved by distributing the load from high-load to lower load bearing areas, thereby optimizing material distribution. The weight optimization of specific components is possible in this way. As continues to be shown, the developed adaptive topology and fibre angle optimization is beneficial from a technological, materialmechanical and economical point of view, and can be applied in everyday practice without any problems. The comparison of theoretical and practical experiments with carbon fibre reinforced plastic prototypes is followed by the display of the weight, stability and stiffness characteristics of the optimization method by means of numerical examinations of FE models. On the basis of these numerical examinations, it has proven possible to develop a method which optimizes the topology and orientation of every single fibre layer of an entire laminate in a simple manner. The result produced is a structural recommendation which complies with the performance capacity of the FPC. The basic orientation of the base layer, the orientation of the individual laminate layers in a manner appropriate to the power flux, as well as the topology of bonding layers and/or the entire laminate are optimized in this design recommendation. Of particular interest here is the adaptive structural optimization of FPC structures with localized bonding to high-load bearing power introduction points or generally, in areas with high tension. The structural optimization of FPC is already done automatically on relatively large components. It has been used several times in practical applications and has produced convincing results through significant improvements to the structural properties of the optimized components.

Fracture testing employed the DCB, ENF. and MMB specimens. Special emphasis was put on microscopic details of crack growth and their relation to fracture resistance. For all fracture mode combinations it was found that crack growth occurred in a nonplanar region of topology determined by the weave pattern and relative positioning of the plies adjacent to the crack plane. The woven fabric structure constrains fiber bridging, but partial debonding of transversely oriented fiber bundles led to occasional crack branching, stick-slip behavior leading to variations in the Mode I fracture resistance. Slow stable crack growth occurred in the ENF and MMB specimens prior to unstable fracture and resulted in nonlinear load-displacement response. A linear relation between the critical values of GI and GII was observed.","Interlaminar fracture; Woven fabric carbon epoxy","Crack propagation; Fracture testing; Fracture toughness; Laminated composites; Topology; Crack branching; Stick slip behavior; Woven fabric carbon/epoxy composites; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0031250638"

The kinetics are described in terms of a Nernst-Planck interdiffusion coefficient of the exchanging ions in a stack of mixed-alkali glass layers with varying ratios of the alkali. The interdiffusion coefficient is suppressed by compression and enhanced by tension. However, the measured surface compression is usually 2-4 times lower than that calculated using thermal stress analogy incorporating an elastic suppression of the molar volume difference of the as-melted mixed-alkali glasses. A new view of the physics of deformations and failure of stress to continue to buildup is presented in an effort to seek technology improvements. Reduced stresses are ascribed to network yield in two separate modes: yielding of the shape-conserving hydrostatic stress component which prevents elastic expansion of molar volume and yielding of the volume-conserving deviatoric (pure shear) stress which leads to measurable shape change. An anomalous subsurface tension is also explained in this view. By drawing analogy to microindentation, it is concluded that optimum network topology glasses should undergo the least plastic deformation and, hence, develop a higher surface compression. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The nanoManipulator system adds a virtual-reality interface to an atomic-force microscope (AFM), thus providing a tool that can be used by scientists to image and manipulate nanometer-sized molecular structures in a controlled manner. As the AFM tip scans the sample, the tip-sample interaction forces are monitored, which, in turn, can yield information about the frictional, mechanical, material, and topological properties of the sample. Computer graphics are used to reconstruct the surface for the user, with color or contours overlaid to indicate additional data sets. Moreover, a force feedback stylus, which is connected to the tip via software, allows the user to directly interact with the macromolecules. This system is being used to investigate carbon nanotubes (CNT's), deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), fibrin, adeno- and tobacco mosaic virus. Nanotubes have been bent, translated, and rotated to understand their mechanical properties and to investigate friction on the molecular level. Using AFM lithography in combination with the nanoManipulator, the electromechanical properties of CNT's are being investigated. The rupture forces of DNA and fibrin fibers have been measured and the elastic moduli of viruses are being studied. It is now also possible to insert this system into a scanning electron microscope which provides the user with continuous images of the sample, even while the AFM tip is being used for manipulations.

Previous simulation studies showed important variations in the level of conducted emissions when DC-DC converters are loaded/driven by different impedances and power network topologies. Several tests have been performed on real DC-DC converters to validate the Pspice model and simulation results. This paper presents these test results. Conducted noise emissions at the input and at the output terminals of DC-DC converters has been measured for different types of power and FEE impedances. Special attention has been paid to influence on the common-mode emissions by the carbon fiber material used to build the mechanical structure of the central detector.

They are among the stiffest and strongest fibers known, and have remarkable electronic properties and many other unique characteristics. In our experiment, CNTs were synthesized using plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition on the silicon wafer with patterned iron catalytic layer. If the catalyst is only located in certain areas (patterned), then nanotubes grow only in those areas. The arrays with freestanding carbon nanotubes were created. It is possible to apply this method of CNTs preparation in many areas, such as sensor-based applications. For example, thanks to the CNTs dimensions is possible to increase the surface in capacitance pressure sensors that are one of the most using in microelectronic devices for pressure sensing. The novel MEMS structure was designed to be utilized as capacitance pressure sensor. The most applicable topology of the MEMS structure was chosen by means of electrostatic models analysis. There were proposed five structures and the best solution was selected the ""chessboard"" structure, since it provides the suitable capacity for the sensor. The computing model supposes geometric symmetry of created CNTs arrays, thanks to that it was necessary to find only two dimensions (width of CNTs array and gap between those arrays). The very first laboratory results measured on fabricated structures show very accurate values which correspond with simulated results. © 2011 TANGER Ltd., Ostrava.","Capacitive sensor; Carbon nanotubes; Micro-electro-mechanical system (MEMS)","Capacitance; Capacitive sensors; Carbon; Electronic properties; MEMS; Microelectronics; Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition; Pressure sensors; Silicon wafers; Yarn; Electrostatic models; Fabricated structures; Geometric symmetry; Graphitic carbons; Micro  electromechanical system (MEMS); Micro-electronic devices; Sensor-based applications; Simulated results; Carbon nanotubes","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84923677209"

The computational procedure is based on constructing complex behavioral fields through Boolean compositions of primitive fields. It is demonstrated that the Boolean compositions efficiently model topological changes caused by the modification/rearrangement of the second phases in the heterogeneous material microstructure. The developed method is applied to evaluate the effective thermal conductivity of two particulate systems, namely, alumina particles in silicone oil and aluminum particles in silicone oil. Three-dimensional simulations of thirty random arrangements of the heterogeneous microstructure at a fixed 58% volume fraction were carried out so as to enable comparisons with experiments (15 measurements of each particle-matrix combination) conducted at an identical volume loading. The microstructures are systematically (and statistically) characterized using matrix-nearest surface exclusion probability functions. The agreement between the experiments and the simulations (mean values were within 10% of each other) validated the near-percolation transport mechanism in these practical material systems. The simulations also underscore the importance of capturing complex three-dimensional (random) particle arrangements and inter-particle interactions. It is demonstrated that these complex three-dimensional microstructural effects may explain experimental results that are sometimes ascribed to an imperfect interface and a non-verifiable interfacial resistance. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Automatic systems for delamination identifications in-service are desired in order to improve this low reliability. At the present work electrical potential technique was applied to detect and locate artificial damage in carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) patched plates. The potential distribution across the surface of the laminates was measured using a grid pattern of 117 electrical contacts on several current injection topologies. A constant current of 1 A was applied to the plate, and the differences in the potential distribution between the virgin plate and five scenarios of damaged plates were recorded and presented graphically in order to define the best current injection topology. Simultaneously a finite element study realized for the same scenarios and using a fine-tuned Matlab visualization code we were able to identify the location and geometry of the artificial damage for all damaged scenarios. © 2012 Taylor & Francis Group, London.","","Bridge decks; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Composite structures; Laminated composites; Plates (structural components); Thermoelectricity; Topology; Carbon fiber reinforced polymer; Delamination identification; Electrical contacts; Electrical potential; Electrical resistances; Finite-element study; Non destructive evaluation; Potential distributions; Nondestructive examination","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84856630460"

Localized melting followed by rapid cooling results in the formation of a weld bead and generation of residual stress. Selection of the appropriate combination of input parameters and understanding their effects is important to achieve the required weld quality with a smooth welding surface. In the present work, a sequentially coupled thermo-structural multiphase analysis was carried out with the objectives of predicting the effect of laser parameters on the change in surface topology of the weld bead and its subsequent effect on structural properties. The work shows that the laser welding parameters strongly affect the weld bead shape, which eventually affects the weld quality. A net shaped weld bead demonstrates better performance in terms of stress distribution and distortion than other weld bead shapes. The numerical simulation results were compared with the experimental observations performed on a mild steel sheet using a fibre laser and the results are in good agreement in terms of weld bead cross-sectional profile and strength. © 2013 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.","CFD; FEM; laser; mild steel; numerical simulation; welding","Carbon steel; Computational fluid dynamics; Computational geometry; Computer simulation; Fiber lasers; Finite element method; Lasers; Low carbon steel; Numerical models; Steel fibers; Welding; Cross sectional profiles; Input parameter; Laser parameters; Laser welding parameters; Localized melting; Multiphase model; Surface topology; Weld bead shapes; Welds","S.

At the same time, as the network traffic largely growing, the size and the cost of network equipments keep increasing so that the network cost reduction is also very important. In recent years, the concept of green Internet was proposed to construct an energy-efficient and cost-optimal green network. In this paper, we firstly present the current studies working on the energy saving and cost reduction in multi-granularity optical network that is the convergence between IP network and optical network to support both the low-speed IP data and the high-speed optical transmission. After analyzing the current studies, in our opinion, the traffic grooming mechanism with optical bypass technology is the feasible solution by binding a lot of low-rate IP data into a few of high-speed lightpaths to reduce a lot of electrical ports consumption in IP routers for saving the energy, the waveband switching mechanism is the feasible solution by binding multiple lightpaths into a few of waveband tunnels to save the optical transmitting ports consumption in Multi-Granularity Optical Cross-Connects (MG-OXCs) for reducing the network costs, and the multi-granularity grooming mechanism is the feasible solution by integrating the traffic grooming with the waveband switching to achieve both the energy saving and cost reduction. Based on our opinion, this paper proposes the challenging issues including the network node model, virtual topology design, certain traffic matrix and uncertain traffic matrix for energy saving and cost reduction in multi-granularity optical network, with possible solutions and preliminary simulation results to guide the future work. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.

The composites are assumed to be periodically ranked by base cells (representative volume elements) whose best possible geometric configurations make the composite's bulk or effective thermal conductivity attaining to the target Milton-Kohn bounds. To avoid checkerboard patterns and generate edge-preserving results in topology optimization, a nonlinear diffusion technique is exploited by introducing the generalized interface energy into the objective function. The adjoint variable method is used to formulate the sensitivity of the objective functions with respect to multi-phase design variables (""relative density""), which guides the method of moving asymptotes to converge along the steepest direction. Unlike the typical density-based method (e.g. SIMP), the penalty factor is no longer needed in this present method after the local conductivity is interpolated by the Hashin-Shtrikman bound other than commonly-used arithmetic bound. In addition to the conventional Vigdergauz-like structures, three new classes of single-length-scale microstructures are generated to closely approach the isotropic Hashin-Strikman bounds in three-phase and two-dimensional cases.

In order to reach the goal of an increasing specific power or a decreasing specific mass, respectively, structural optimization methods, like the topology optimization, find their way into the design process to a greater extent. Additionally one is going to consider more and more fiber reinforced composites as a substitute for titanium alloys in the ""cold"" structure of the engine. Composite materials offer significant advantages especially concerning the specific mass and the adjustability of their stiffliess properties. Unfortunately it is very difficult to predict damage and fracture of such orthotropic materials. The presentation will show the results of a topology optimization of the titanium intermediate-casing of a Rolls- Royce aero engine. Further on the material of the casing will be substituted by a carbon fiber reinforced composite. The fiber orientations and layer thicknesses of the composite are optimized under certain strength constraints, which are described by a modern fracture plane based failure criterion (NASA LaRCO4 criterion [6]). Such a failure criterion has a lot of advantages compared to classical ones like TSAI-HILL, TSAI-WU which e.g. do not distinguish between fiber and inter-fiber fracture and are therefore not able to predict the type of inter-fiber fracture. Finally the results of the optimization with the current material titanium will be compared to the results of the composite-made intermediate casing in terms of their load capacity and weight.

Although a significant amount of optimisation remains to be done to fully exploit the benefits of long fibre composites, these materials are relatively speaking still very crude, when compared to what nature has achieved with wood or bone for example. Nanomaterials, and specifically carbon nanotubes (CNTs), have teased with their spectacular mechanical and physical properties in isolation. These headline properties have prompted much work into the manufacturing of composite materials using CNTs as reinforcements, but thus far, successful exploitation of these impressive properties has been modest. A gap remains before these materials represent a real competition to long carbon fibre composites, even though fairly modest applications such as CNTs as fillers for matrix toughening and imparting electrical functionality are showing some promise. In this paper a critique is made of various reinforcement approaches through the lens of 'nano-augmented', 'nano-engineered' and 'nano-enabled' categories as defined by Airbus. These approaches are compared to an analysis of nature's 'baseline'. A new 'nano-enabled' strategy for the growth of fully aligned and dispersed bulk CNT composite materials and structures, allowing for simultaneous multi-scalar morphological and topological optimisation, is described. This new strategy, analogous to nature's approach, consists of the vapour phase growth of aligned forests of carbon nanotubes coupled to the environment of Additive Layer Manufacturing (ALM). Early feasibility results are presented and currently identified challenges to successful scale-up are discussed. © 2011 Materials Research Society.","","Carbon Fibers; Composites; Forests; Mechanical Properties; Physical Properties; Polymers; Carbon fibers; Carbon nanotubes; Composite materials; Mechanical properties; Optimization; Carbon fibre composites; Carbon nanotube reinforced composites; Carbon nanotubes (CNTs); Composite materials and structures; Layer manufacturing; Materials technology; Mechanical and physical properties; Morphology-controlled; Net-shape; Optimisations; Polymer composite; Scale-up; Through the lens; Vapour-phase; Reinforcement","","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84860182204"

Defined by its interconnections and routing policies, it has fuelled increased demands for provisioning of new more advanced services that are able to dynamically react to changes within the network. These services however, lead to enormous energy consumption in contrast to a global drive for a greener environment. Hence the existence of an optical infrastructure that complies with the principles of zero-carbon emission is imperative. Subsequently, in this paper, we present an energy model of Generalized Multi-Protocol Label Switching (GMPLS) network for more power efficient Green Photonic Networks. We are proposing a greener network design based on a novel routing algorithm to deliver power reduction through implementation of so called ""Hibernation"" approach. The scheme includes network topology such as group the nodes configuration, segmentation of the link/ports, and wavelength provisioning via partitioning. The performance evaluations of these energy saving schemes are investigated by including various challenging issue on ""greening the internet"" and reduces carbon footprint. In addition, to study the impact of wavelength request, blocking probability and power consumption in relation to network load is taken into account. A trade-off is observed between energy per bit, wavelengths offered (Erlang) and blocking probability as a result of the idling nodes. © 2010 IEEE.","Energy efficiency; GMPLS; Green photonic networks; Power consumption","Blocking probability; Electric network topology; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fiber optic networks; Internet; Internet protocols; Photonics; Routing protocols; Telecommunication networks; Carbon emissions; Carbon footprint; Energy consumption; Energy model; Energy saving; Energy-per-bit; Generalized multi-protocol label switching networks; GMPLS; Green photonic networks; Network design; Network load; Network topology; Performance evaluation; Photonic network; Power Consumption; Power efficient; Power reductions; Routing policies; Transparent optical networks","","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-77957264999"

We review experimental results of CNT-mediated delivery of small molecules, DNA, proteins, and vaccines, and the potential of CNTs as matrices to support and stimulate neural growth. Last, we examine some toxicological and biocompatibility issues related to the use of CNTs as pharmaceutical excipients and discuss attributes that affect toxicity, such as structure (single-walled vs. multi-walled CNTs), length and aspect ratio, surface area, degree of aggregation, extent of oxidation, surface topology, bound functional group(s), and method of manufacturing. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Glass fiber having surface amino groups as initiator sites was prepared by treatment of the glass fiber with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane. Grafting reaction of the hyperbranched dendritic polyamidoamine from the glass fiber surface was achieved by repeating Michael addition of methyl acrylate to surface amino groups followed by amination of end groups, which is the reaction of the resulting ester moieties with ethylenediamine or hexamethylenediamine. Both the amount of terminal amino groups and the percentage of grafting of the resulting polyamidoamine increased with an increase in the number of generations. Ethylenediamine as a reactant in amination was more effective than hexamethylenediamine for the propagation of the hyperbranched dendritic polyamidoamine. However, the propagation of the polyamidoamine from glass fiber surface was found to proceed imperfectly because the amount of terminal amino groups determined by titration was considerably smaller than the theoretical value. Furthermore, living poly(isobutyl vinyl ether) and living poly(2-methyl-2-oxazoline) with controlled molecular weight and narrow molecular weight distribution readily postgrafted to the hyperbranched dendritic polyamidoamine grafted onto the glass fiber surface by termination of the corresponding living polymer cation with terminal amino groups of the polyamidoamine. © 199 VSP.","Carbon fiber: short fiber; Deformation; Microscopic failure; Raman spectroscopy: composite; Stress analysis","Addition reactions; Amination; Esters; Glass fibers; Grafting (chemical); Molecular weight distribution; Nitrogen compounds; Methyl acrylate; Michael addition; Polyamidoamine; Organic polymers","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0033300542"

In this model, the inclusions can be arranged at random positions in a composite material that is simulated by 10×10×10 cubic cells. Under the quasi-static approximation, numerical calculations are performed using the finite element method (FEM). In order to get the effective dielectric properties of isotropic composites, an averaging method is adopted because each topological structure of a given disordered model is anisotropic. Then the effect of the permittivity contrast between the inclusions and the matrix phase of composites is studied. The numerical results obtained by the disordered model are also compared with those obtained by the classical mixing rules and the conventional periodic models. ©2008 IEEE.","","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Ceramic capacitors; Dielectric properties; Dielectric properties of solids; Dielectric waveguides; Materials science; Metallic matrix composites; Mixing; Numerical analysis; Numerical methods; Permittivity; Structural optimization; Technical presentations; Three dimensional; Two phase flow; Averag ing methods; Classical mixing rules; Cubic cells; Dielectric constants; Electrical insulation; Finite element method FEM; International symposium; Isotropic composites; Matrix phase; Numerica l results; Numerical calculations; Periodic models; Quasi-static approximation; Topological structures; Finite element method","X.

Surface energy effects in the spreading of polymer droplets on fiber surfaces are discussed; then a model for the consolidation process is developed, relating the variables mentioned above. Consolidation experiments on powder-impregnated composites of the FIT type (Fibres Impregnees de Thermoplastique) were carried out using a mold attached to a servo-hydraulic testing machine. The model accurately predicts variations in void content during consolidation of carbon fiber/PEEK (CF/PEEK) and carbon fiber/PEI (CF/PEI) laminates. It was found that, at the pressures needed to achieve rapid consolidation, surface energy has a negligible influence on impregnation rate, but its effects on the void topology can be considerable. It was also shown that, when laminates of low void content are required, a minimum pressure is needed to overcome the effect of fiber bed elasticity. © 1995, TECHNOMIC PUBLISHING CO., INC.

CNTs can be used as on-chip optical antenna for wireless interconnects. Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNTFETs) show significant performance as photodetectors due to wide spectral region and tunable bandgap. In this paper, CNTFETs composed of semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) and metal contacts (M-SWNT-M) are used as photodiode receivers in nanoscale optical communication by theoretically modeling diameter-dependent characteristics for shot-, dark-, and thermal-noise-limited cases. Bit error rate (BER), cutoff bit rate, and signal-to-noise ratio performance are analyzed for intensity modulation and direct detection modulation. The multireceiver CNT nanoscale network topology is presented for information broadcast and the minimum SNR is maximized solving NP-hard max-min power allocation problem with semidefinite programming relaxation and branch and bound framework. The significant performance improvement is observed compared with uniform power allocation. Derived model is compared with existing experiments and hundreds of Mb/s data rate is achievable with very low BERs.

A nonlinear viscoelastic constitutive model is developed, and its material parameters are determined by fitting it to creep test data. Model results are found to agree very well with the experimental data at low temperature and low stress conditions. However, the agreement deteriorates at high temperatures, particularly in the vicinity of the glass transition temperature. An alternative model based on an artificial neural network (ANN) is developed to predict the stress relaxation of the polymer matrix composite. The ANN model is trained and validated with 9000 experimental data sets obtained from stress relaxation tests performed at various constant strain (initial stress) and constant temperature conditions. Training of the ANN employs a scaled conjugate gradient method. The optimal brain surgeon algorithm is employed to optimize the topology. The optimal ANN configuration has 88 processing elements (3 in the input layer, 45 in the first hidden layer, 39 in the second hidden layer, and 1 in the output layer) and 410 links. The predictions of the ANN model are found to be more accurate over a wider range of stress and temperature conditions than those of the explicit nonlinear viscoelastic model, in particular near the glass transition temperature.","Constitutive behavior; Material testing; Neural network; Nonlinear viscoelastic model; Polymeric composite","Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Composite materials; Glass transition; Neural networks; Stresses; Constitutive behavior; Material testing; Neural network; Nonlinear viscoelastic model; Polymeric composite; Polymers","M.Y.

As a rule, these changes are described within the frameworks of polymer’s crystalline morphology. However, lately the fractal model has been developed, which takes into consideration the whole complexity of polymers structure. It is assumed that changes occur not only on supramolecular level, but also on molecular and topological levels [2]. It is necessary to take into consideration simultaneously, that crystalline phase morphology variation causes non crystalline regions structure changes [3]. The introduction in semicrystalline polymer inorganic nanofiller results, as a rule, in polymer matrix crystallinity degree increase, since nanofiller particles serve as nucleators. Such effect was observed in nanocomposites high density polyethylene or calcium carbonate (HDPE or CaCO3) [4, 5]. Let us note an important feature of semicrystalline polymers filling: nanofiller introduction can result in both reduction and enhancement of polymer matrix crystallinity degree K. So, the authors [6] found K decrease from 0.72 to 0.38 at carbon fibers introduction in HDPE at its volume content φn = 0.303. Therefore, the purpose of present paper is quantitative description of polypropylene crystalline phase structural changes on the above indicated structural levels after the introduction of carbon nanotubes in it. © 2014 by Apple Academic Press, Inc.","Carbon nanotubes (CNT); Crystallization; Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC); Polymer nanocomposites; Polypropylene (PP)","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon nanotubes; Crystalline materials; Crystallinity; Crystallization; Differential scanning calorimetry; High density polyethylenes; Morphology; Polypropylenes; Application of polymers; Crystalline morphologies; Crystalline structure; Matrix crystallinity; Polymer nanocomposite; Quantitative description; Semi-crystalline polymer; Supramolecular level; Nanocomposites","","Book chapter","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85054703307"

As the AFM tip scans the surface of these structures, the tip-sample interaction forces are monitored, which in turn provide information about the frictional, mechanical, and topological properties of the sample. Computer graphics are used to reconstruct the surface for the user, with color or contours overlaid to indicate additional data sets. Moreover, by means of a force-feedback pen, which is connected to the scanning tip via software, the user can touch the surface under investigation to feel it and to manipulate objects on it. This system has been used to investigate carbon nanotubes, fibrin, DNA, adenovirus, and tobacco mosaic virus. Nanotubes have been bent, translated, and rotated to understand their mechanical properties and to investigate friction on the molecular level. AFM lithography is being combined with the nanoManipulator to investigate the electromechanical properties of carbon nanotubes. The rupture forces of fibrin and DNA have been measured. This article discusses how some of the graphics and interface features of the nanoManipulator made these novel investigations possible.

The wing topology can be tailored to obtain the desired change in aerodynamic performance through passive shape adaptation. Pre-tension of the membrane plays a major role in the static and dynamic response of membrane wings and controls the overall deflections. In the past, the methods used to apply pretension when fabricating MAV wings were rudimentary. A new technique of attaching membranes firmly on wing structures is introduced, which involves the application of a technology known as corona treatment combined with another repeatable method of tensioning silicone membranes on any given frame geometry. Corona treatment provided a means of increasing adhesion of silicone on carbon fiber through the use of a high-frequency high-voltage air plasma discharge. The silicone membrane is co-cured with carbon fiber under vacuum pressure at an elevated temperature. After cool down, the membrane is tensioned. © The Society for Experimental Mechanics, Inc. 2013.","Carbon fiber; Corona treatment; Digital image correlation; MAVs; Membrane wings; Micro air vehicles; Pre-tension; Silicone rubber film; Strain; Stress; Thermal expansion; Visual image correlation; Width tapered double cantilever beam; Wing manufacturing","Carbon fibers; Composite materials; Dynamic response; Electric discharges; Image analysis; Micro air vehicle (MAV); Silicones; Strain; Stresses; Thermal expansion; Wings; Corona treatment; Digital image correlations; Double cantilever beam; MAVs; Pre-tension; Silicone rubber; Visual image; Membranes","Y.J.

Developing energy-efficient technologies for optical access networks is therefore crucial for the continuous scaling of the Internet. In this paper, we model the power consumption of different transceivers and demonstrate how various electronic and photonic technologies can help improve energy efficiency.

Here, we develop a model that is capable of determining the strength and toughness of elastic-plastic composites from the properties, percentages, and arrangement of its constituents, and of estimating the corresponding dissipated energy during damage progression, in crack-opening control. Specifically, we adopt a fiber bundle model approach with a hierarchical multiscale self-similar procedure which enables to span various orders of magnitude in size and to explicitly take into account the hierarchical topology of natural materials. Hierarchical architectures and self-consistent energy dissipation mechanisms (including plasticity), both omitted in common fiber bundle models, are fully considered in our model. By considering one of the toughest known materials today as an example application, a synthetic fiber composed of single-walled carbon nanotubes and polyvinyl alcohol gel, we compute strength and specific energy absorption values that are consistent with those experimentally observed. Our calculations are capable of predicting these values solely based on the properties of the constituent materials and knowledge of the structural multiscale topology. Due to the crack-opening control nature of the simulations, it is also possible to derive a critical minimal percentage of plastic component needed to avoid catastrophic behavior of the material. These results suggest that the model is capable of helping in the design of new supertough materials. © 2010 The American Physical Society.","","Carbon Fibers; Cracks; Dissipation Factor; Energy; Plasticity; Polyvinyl Alcohol; Silk; Synthetic Fibers; Carbon fibers; Cracks; Electric network topology; Energy dissipation; Functional materials; Silk; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN); Constituent materials; Crack-opening; Damage progression; Dissipated energy; Elastic-Plastic; Energy dissipation mechanism; Fiber bundle models; Hierarchical architectures; Hierarchical simulation; Hierarchical structures; Hierarchical topology; Multiscales; Nano scale; Natural materials; Orders of magnitude; Plastic components; Polyvinyl alcohol gels; Self-similar; Specific energy absorption; Spider silks; Strength and toughness; Biological materials","N.

The development process was driven extensively by virtual engineering, which applied CAE analysis and results to drive the design and improve the design efficiency. Topology optimization and section optimization were used to generate the initial design's shape, form and profile, while respecting the package requirements of the engine compartment. Concept selection, geometry sensitivity studies and concept refinement methods were then used to optimize the design, considering manufacturing constraints and all critical load cases.

The sensor measures acetylene (C2H2) gas concentration. A 1-m length of photonic bandgap fibre (PBGF) was filled with acetylene at atmospheric pressure, then fusion spliced to standard, solid-core, single-mode SMF-28 fibre to form a compact, coilable, reference cell without the need for any lenses or bulk optics. As the cell contained a gas volume <5 μL, it presents a greatly reduced hazard even when filled with explosive or harmful gases. Acetylene concentration measurements were made by comparing the absorption spectrum of this reference cell with that of a bulk optics measurement cell containing test gases, using a simple sensing topology requiring no spectrally selective components. Our sensor had a noise-limited sensitivity of 100 ppm acetylene using 4 s averaging time. Pure carbon dioxide gave a cross-sensitivity equivalent to 150 ppm acetylene. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

As hover-capable artificial flapping flight has been realized in micro/nano air vehicles (by Aerovironment Inc.), the technical challenge for creating an efficient flapping wing has attracted more research attention. This work presents the current flapping wing structure development at University of Florida, in tailoring the flexibility and mass distribution of membrane-laminated and carbon-fiber-skeletonized anisotropic flexible wings: the wing skeletal topology has been designed for enhancing passive deformation for a one-degree-of-freedom kinematics; the cross-section of each skeletal member is controlled with modern manufacturing techniques to produce the designed structure; and the final wing is carefully examined for its thrust generation efficiency and aeroelastic properties (wing deformation). Several challenging aspects are overcome: realizing a varying skeletal cross-section to achieve a controlled stiffness to weight ratio, determining the skeletal topology and mass distribution, developing a reliable and consistent manufacturing technique and examining the wings with different methods. The results show that a more energy efficient design can be achieved with the developed manufacturing techniques that allow for complicated structures.

Its unique electronic and photonic properties lead to applications such as transistors, graphene photodetectors (GPDs), and electronic circuit components. Metal-graphene-metal (MGM) GPDs with single- or multilayer graphene sheets are promising for future nanoscale optical communication architectures because of wide range absorption from far infrared to visible spectrum, fast carrier velocity, and advanced production techniques due to planar geometry. In this paper, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), bit-error rate (BER), and data rate performances of nanoscale single-layer symmetric MGM photodetectors are analyzed for intensity modulation and direct detection (IM/DD) modulation. Shot and thermal noise limited (NL) performances are analyzed emphasizing graphene layer width dependence and domination of thermal NL characteristics for practical power levels. Tens of Gbit/s data rates are shown to be achievable with very low BERs for single-receiver (SR) GPDs. Furthermore, multireceiver (MR) GPDs and parallel line-scan (PLS) network topology are defined improving the efficiency of symmetric GPDs. SNR performance of SR PLS channels are both improved and homogenized with MR devices having the same total graphene area by optimizing their positions with max-min solutions and using maximal ratio and equal gain diversity combining techniques. © 2002-2012 IEEE.","Diversity combining; graphene; optical network; parallel line-scan (PLS); photodetector","Antennas; Electric network topology; Fiber optic networks; Geometry; Information theory; Nanotechnology; Optical communication; Photodetectors; Atomic layer; Carbon sheets; Carrier velocity; Communication architectures; Data rates; Diversity combining; Equal gain diversity; Far infrared; Graphene layers; Graphene sheets; Intensity modulation and direct detections; Max-min; Maximal-ratio; MR devices; Multi-receiver; Nano scale; Network topology; parallel line-scan (PLS); Photonic properties; Physical science; Planar geometries; Power levels; Production techniques; Signaltonoise ratio (SNR); Single layer; Theoretical modeling; Graphene","B.

Two scanning probe microscopes have been found to be particularly useful for this task. Both the scanning tunneling microscope (STM) and the atomic force microscope (AFM) use probes that are precisely rastered across the surface with piezoelectric tubes. These microscopes are able to image atomic topology and have been used by several investigators to characterize various carbon fiber surfaces. The effects of various carbon fiber surface treatments have also been documented by the STM. In the normal force mode, the AFM has been shown to be useful in documenting the growth of silica deposits on the fiber surface, while in the force modulation mode the AFM is able to display an image that contains information on the modulus of the surface, in addition to topographical information. Various other scanning probe microscopes are discussed. © 1992.","AFM; atomic force microscope; carbon fibers; scanning probe microscopy; scanning tunneling microscope; STM; surface characterization","Carbon Carbon Composites - Mechanical Properties; Carbon Fiber - Adhesion; Microscopic Examination - Scanning Electron Microscopy; Surface Treatment - Effects; Atom Force Microscopy; Scanning Probe Microscopy; Scanning Tunneling Microscopy; Carbon Fiber","","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-0026771608"
