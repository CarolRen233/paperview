Numerous solutions and drilling practices are applied in the field to mitigate, prevent or cure LC. Among these, the application of lost circulation materials (LCM) in the drilling fluids for plugging flow paths has been a widely accepted practice. LCM like ground marble, graphitic carbon and fibers are well-known to the industry. Different outcomes have been reported in laboratory tests and field applications when LCM is used in aqueous drilling fluids (AF) as opposed to non-aqueous drilling fluids (NAF). The present work provides a novel rheological tool to distinguish plugging performance of fiber-laden LCM in AF and NAF. The LCM plugging performance is determined by conducting tests on permeability plugging apparatus (PPA) using a tapered slot (TS) on combination of fibers and particulates like ground marble and resilient graphitic carbon. It was observed that several combinations of fibers and particulates formed a plug in TS with minimal fluid loss in aqueous drilling fluids; however, when tested in NAF, LC was difficult to control. To investigate the above performance difference, tests were conducted with an Anton Paar rheometer. Rotational rheometry is performed to measure first normal stress difference (N1) at low and moderate shears. It is found that the fiber contribution towards N1 in aqueous fluids is remarkably different from that in NAF. Microscopically, this difference in N1 could be attributed to the distinct fiber properties and orientation in these two systems that explain their contrasting performance in PPA analysis. Thus, the rheological technique provides a tool to identify LC control ability of the fiber-laden LCM system and optimize the concentration of fibers and LCM during the planning phase of drilling fluids.

Finite element analysis (FEA) is used to optimize layup directions, which need to be transformed into viable tool paths for automated fiber placement (AFP) processes. Manufacturing defects such as wrinkles, gaps, and overlaps should be handled. In this study, a novel path planning algorithm is developed for variable steering in AFP.

It is made with light weight carbon fiber material in order to minimize its water-equivalent thickness. However, the design uses two rails underneath the couch in order to support the weight of the patient. These rails are structured frames made of high density carbon fiber with larger water-equivalent thickness. Moreover, depending on the relative orientation between the rail structures and the incident beam angles, the water-equivalent thickness can change significantly. Common clinical practice assumes that the rails are out of the beam path for planning and relies on the treatment staff to ensure that the rails are in the designated position relative to the patient during actual treatment. This study examines the dosimetric effects of the rails. Methods: A Qfix kVue table with rails was scanned using computed tomography (CT) and proton pencil beam scanning plans were generated with and without rails in the beam path. The impact of the rails on the proton range and dose distribution was studied in a virtual water tank and a test patient. Results: The water-equivalent thickness of the rails varies from a few millimeters to a few centimeters, depending on the beam angle and the location. In general, range of the proton beam is reduced most significantly and the dose disturbed most drastically when the beam traverses parallel through the outer and/ or inner edges of the rails. Conclusions: Rails have a sizable and non-uniform impact on the dose distribution. They should be kept out of the beam path during treatment. © 2022 by the Author(s).",kvue rails; pencil beam scanning; proton therapy,carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites; proton; water; article; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; dosimetry; proton therapy; radiation dose distribution; railway,"L.

Intensive labor work needs to be conducted, and poor surface quality and weak interfacial adhesion are usually observed. This work mainly introduces an in situ online repairing method using AM (additive manufacturing) facilitated composite fabrication. With the advances of the robotic-assisted AM process, the surface roughness and accuracy during the repairing process can be evaluated online upon layer-by-layer process. In order to fulfill the efficient and on-site requirements for repairing damage in structural components, this study explores the method including in situ repairing, laser point clouds online collection, and repairing path planning based on multi-axial additive manufacturing of composites. A repair algorithm is proposed incorporating point clouds collection, measurement evaluation, and path planning. Furthermore, relevant mechanical measurements have been conducted, so as to assess the interface degree of recovery. A rapid online evaluation and surface conformal repairing method have been proposed to overcome the technical bottleneck of in situ automatic repairing of damaged composites.

Through control planning of robot motion, simulation and experiment on Paving pressure and paving speed are carried out, and on this basis analysis and optimization are carried out. In the analysis of laying pressure, the deformation of rigid press roll and flexible press roll under different pressures is analyzed by finite element simulation. According to the laying experiment, it is certain that the flexible press roll can obtain better laying quality when laying; different pressures are selected to lay the tow. The laying range of these pressures is determined as 50–250 N according to the quality of the tow. In the temperature experiment, the temperature change of the tow in different layers under different laying speeds is analyzed. Through the experiment, it is found that there is a strong correlation between the laying speed and the laying temperature. The experiment also found that under a certain laying speed, selecting the corresponding heating temperature range can obtain higher laying quality and that selecting appropriate paving process parameters, conducting paving tests, and conducting trajectory planning based on the process can effectively reduce paving defects. Finally, in order to solve the problem of path planning for thin-wall structure carbon fiber placement, a natural path algorithm based on Laplace smoothing is proposed. The algorithm obtains the grid surface through the discretization of the thin-walled surface structure, smooths the grid using the Laplace method, and uses the natural path method to obtain the trajectory. At the same time, the algorithm also considers the layout path boundary and layer design, etc. The problem is to complete the trajectory planning through the fiber path assisted generation software and compare the trajectory points with the traditional surface mesh method to verify the rationality of the trajectory algorithm. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering 2023.",cf/peek; flexible press roll; paving pressure; paving speed; paving track; rigid press roll,CFRP; fiber; heating temperature; laplace transforms; milling (machining); pavement; presses (machine tools); robot programming; thin walled structures; trajectory; carbon fiber reinforced components; cf/peek; flexible press roll; paving pressure; paving speed; paving track; press roll; process parameters; rigid press roll; motion planning,"Z.

The optimal design was performed with a cantilever beam to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The optimization result obtained by the proposed optimization method showed that the fiber orientation was consistent within each component, facilitating the subsequent manufacturing process. For comparative analysis, the optimal structures were also obtained by density-based topology optimization methods with traditional printing path strategies. The results of the comparison experiment showed that, compared with the specimens optimized by the solid orthotropic material with penalization (SOMP) method with off-set paths and the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) method with zig-zag paths, the stiffness of the optimal specimens obtained by proposed multi-scale components optimization method with continuous printing paths was increased by 26.39% and 64.67%, respectively, and the peak load was increased by 50.45% and 37.53%, respectively.

A weft insertion system that meets the process requirements has been designed. The analysis of the functional requirements for the continuous weft insertion system has identified five key nodes for the system, and the motion paths of each mechanism have been established. Through design methods such as analytical methods, rigid inversion methods, and mechanical analysis, the modular design of the system and the planning of the timing sequence for multiple mechanisms have been completed. Weft insertion experiments have been conducted on a continuous weft insertion system experimental platform, and the results demonstrate that the weft insertion system can effectively introduce carbon fiber bundles into the narrow channels, forming the expected S-shaped continuous weft insertion trajectory. This study verifies the feasibility of the designed weft insertion system and the accuracy of the continuous weft insertion theory, providing a viable solution for continuous weft insertion in the narrow channels of soft–hard blended preforms. © The Author(s) 2024.",continuous carbon fiber bundles; narrow channels; s-shaped trajectory; soft–hard blended preform; weft insertion system,analysis; package; fiber; interpolation; preform; specification; system; trajectory; design of experiments; preform; continuous carbon fiber bundles; design verification; experimental verification; fibre bundle; narrow channels; s-shaped; s-shaped trajectory; soft–hard blended preform; weft insertion system; weft insertions; trajectory,"J.

Three honeycomb designs—star shaped (SS), concave hexagonal (CHH), and zero Poisson's ratio (ZPR)—are evaluated through static compression experiments and finite element simulations. The results show that the SS honeycomb with a negative Poisson's ratio exhibits higher yield strength, faster densification, and greater total energy absorption. In contrast, the positive Poisson's ratio (PPR) honeycomb demonstrates larger specific energy absorption, while ZPR structures are more stable in deformation. Notably, for structures with the same negative Poisson's ratio, the SS honeycomb outperforms the CHH in terms of total and mass specific energy absorption, with increases of 98.58% and 101%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis of fiber damage mechanisms during compression highlights the influence of unit cell design and printing path planning on the mechanical properties of CCFRC components. These findings suggest that the mechanical behavior of CCFRC honeycomb structures is highly dependent on design and print path planning, with tensile failure typically leading to brittle fracture. © 2025 Wiley-VCH GmbH.",continuous carbon fiber-reinforced composites; finite element analysis (fea); fused filament fabrication; honeycomb structures,carbon carbon composites; CFRP; honeycomb structures; poisson ratio; tensile strength; carbon fiber reinforced composite; continuous carbon fiber-reinforced composites; finite element analyse; fused filament fabrication; mechanical performance; negative poisson ratio; specific energy absorption; asteroid; tunables; zero poisson's ratios; brittle fracture,"L.

Safety is mostly linked to avoiding collisions between the human and the robot but the pertinent measures adopted should prolong task duration as little as possible. In order to test such measures in HRC pertinent algorithms need to be applied, which is made possible without jeopardising human safety only in an Extended Reality environment. In order to implement path planning algorithms and human–robot interaction rules freely the environment must be open. In this work, the development of such an environment is presented and demonstrated by example of laying up carbon fibre fabric sheets in a mould. An existing open platform was substantially extended by embedding robot control functionality concerning motion, path and trajectory planning emphasizing static and dynamic obstacle detection, interactive input and manipulation and real-time path planning, whereas trajectory planning focused on ensuring acceptability of joint motion solutions using inverse kinematics. Two different real-time path planning methods are embedded in the environment as representative examples. The first one is the established ‘Rapidly exploring Random Tree’ (RRT) algorithm followed by path optimization. The second one is ‘Machine-Learned Path Planning’ (MLPP) a prototype machine learning model trained using linear regression with Gaussian noise based on safe path planning data generated by users. The evaluation criteria of these methods were the number and severity of collisions as well as the total completion time of the manufacturing task. In the particular case examined, the machine learning technique proved much faster than RRT but not as safe, despite its potential. However, the openness of the XR platform enables testing of any other strategy supporting HRC in manufacturing before it is actually transcribed to the real robot controller. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.",dynamic collision avoidances; extended reality; human robot collaboration; industrial cobot; safety,gaussian distribution; gaussian noise (electronic); human robot interaction; industrial robots; intelligent robots; inverse problems; linear regression; motion planning; obstacle detectors; robot learning; robot programming; toy manufacture; dynamic collision avoidances; extended reality; human safety; human's dexterity; human-robot collaboration; industrial cobot; rapidly-exploring random trees; real time path planning; robot accuracy; robot path; inverse kinematics,"G.-C.

Considering the decarbonization of the whole automotive industry, in addition to reducing the CO2 emissions from fuel supply and exhaust pipes, which account for 65–80 % of the total value chain CO2 emissions, the automotive industry should also accelerate the decarbonization of raw materials, which contribute to 18–22 % of these CO2 emissions. Many automotive manufacturers are collaborating with steel producers on green steel initiatives due to the high CO2 emissions from steel production, the integrated nature of the steel supply chain, and the need for early planning in low-carbon steel production routes transformation. To clarify the carbon emission characteristic of the automotive steel supply chain, this research establishes a mathematical method for calculating cradle-to-gate carbon footprint of automotive steel product based on BF (Blast furnace)-BOF (Basic oxygen furnace), Scrap-EAF (Electric arc furnace), and DRI (Direct reduced iron)-EAF steel production routes. The cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of BF-BOF, Scrap-EAF, and DRI-EAF steel production routes are 1711.84 kgCO2/t-sp (steel product), 916.39 kgCO2/t-sp, and 2738.53 kgCO2/t-sp. A projection of CO2 emissions in automotive steel supply chain from 2020 to 2060 has been investigated, taking into account production structure adjustment, scrap recycling, and low-carbon electricity adoption, as well as the demand for automotive steel products. Projections from 2020 to 2060 indicate that the CO2 emission intensity of the automotive steel supply chain will decrease by 28.25 % by 2030 and 93.99 % by 2060, with total emissions dropping by 28.47 % and 96.92 %, respectively. This research identifies effective decarbonization measures in the automotive steel supply chain, including internal and end-of-life (EOL) steel scrap recycling, which offer significant CO2 emissions reduction without increased costs, demonstrating high cost-effectiveness. In a word, this research provides a technical framework and data foundation for decarbonizing the automotive steel supply chain. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",automotive industry; carbon footprint; decarbonization pathways; recommendation; steel production,China; automotive industry; basic oxygen converters; basic oxygen process; bessemer process; carbon footprint; cement; competition; concrete construction; cost reduction; critical path analysis; crushed stone plants; diamond deposits; net_income; emission control; flue gases; graphite fibers; inventory control; iron and steel industry; iron research; iron scrap; losings; low carbon steel; petroleum tar; pilot plants; resource valuation; scrap metal reprocessing; steel scrap; steelmaking furnaces; supply chains; synthetic diamonds; automotive steels; automotives; co 2 emission; decarbonisation; decarbonization pathways; production route; recommendation; steel production; steel products; steel supply; automobile industry; carbon emission; carbon footprint; electricity generation; expansion; fuel; numerical methods; steel; blast furnaces,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85206433429

The MEQS method addresses the low fibre infill rate issue of the traditional Equally-Spaced (EQS) method by utilising the Offset method to generate looped printing paths around the internal cavities and gaps between continuous fibre paths. The developed MEQS method was first illustrated against EQS and Offset methods using an open-hole composite plate in which topology and material orientation were simultaneously optimised using the discrete–continuous parameterisation (DCP) method. Actual printing path-based finite element modelling showed that the MEQS method achieves a 25.32% increase in stiffness compared to the Offset method. Experimental testing of the additively manufactured open-hole composite plates showed that the MEQS method improves the stiffness and strength by 15.52% and 27.38%, respectively, compared to the Offset method. The proposed MEQS was further demonstrated through two other case studies by finite element modelling, showing that the stiffness of MEQS has increased by an average of 66.71% and 14.95% compared to EQS and Offset, respectively. © 2024 The Author(s)",additive manufacturing (am); continuous fibres; finite element analysis (fea); printing path planning; topology optimisation,additive; CFRP; CFRP; finite element method; motion planning; plates (structural components); stiffness; structure (composition); topology; composite plates; composites structures; continuous fibers; element models; fibre placement; finite element analyse; offset method; open holes; printing path planning; topology optimisation; 3d printing,"J.

Since its inceptions, this technique has been mainly used for simple geometries; however, research has led to the possibility of increasingly complex structures. One such type of complex geometry to be investigated is a strut. Struts are largely seen in structures such as lunar landers and aircraft. The layup of such a complex geometry produces defects that can hinder the structural performance of the final part. This report investigates the manufacturability of such a geometry by investigating the geometry and path planning combined with a tool to rapidly iterate on the design variables. The result is a strut geometry optimal for limiting defects with predicted manufacturability scores displaying potential issues that could be seen in the manufacturing process. Copyright 2021.

The designability of CFRP structures and fiber distributions provides an opportunity for achieving better physical properties through optimization. However, local optima and the dependence of initial fiber angle variables make the concurrent optimization of fiber orientation and topology a challenging problem. In this paper, the principal stress orientation interpolated continuous fiber angle optimization (PSO-CFAO) method combined with the independent continuous mapping (ICM) method is proposed to realize the design of CFRP structures with a clear macroscopic topology and microscopic fiber distribution. A sigmoid function is applied to interpolate the fiber angle variables by the principal stress orientation. The fiber angle variables are modified and a continuous fiber design is obtained during the iteration process, which reduces the possibility of a local optimum. Several examples are provided to prove the effectiveness and stability of the proposed method, and the expected results are acquired for different initial fiber angles, material parameters and mesh densities. The proposed method provides guidance for the design of CFRP structures and the planning of fiber laying paths. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",continuous fiber angle optimization; continuous fiber reinforced polymer; principal stress orientation; topology optimization method,CFRP; fiber; iterative methods; particle swarm optimization (pso); shape optimization; continuous fiber angle optimization; continuous fiber reinforced polymer; continuous fibers; fiber angles; fiber-reinforced polymers; fibre reinforced polymers; optimization; principal stress orientation; principal stress orientation; stress orientations; topology optimisation; topology,"H.

In this work, we proposed a vision based measure algorithm with two custom metrics to quantitatively evaluate two typical defects: misalignment and twist, in the ME based CFRP fabrication process. Based on the proposed algorithm and metrics, we explored the effects of four printing parameters on the defects under different path radii for co-extrusion based process with Taguchi method. The experiments illustrate Fibre Feed Rate and Printing Speed have significant influences on fibre misalignment, whereas these parameters only show minor influences on fibre twist. Additionally, it is found that reduced printing radius can introduce more error to the defects, especially for fibre twist. Based on the analysis, optimum conditions for infill path with different curvature radii are proposed and the results of confirmation experiments support the proposed adaptive search method for printing parameters. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",additive manufacturing (am); continuous fibre reinforced polymers; curved infill path; material extrusion; process planning,,"Y.

Manual programming of cooperating robots is difficult, but with large numbers of different sized and shaped cut-pieces, it is almost impossible. This paper presents an automated production system consisting of a camera for the precise detection of the position of each cut-piece and a collision-free path planner which can dynamically react to different positions for the transfer motions. The path is planned for multiple robots adhering to motion constrains, such as the requirement that the textile cut-piece must form a catenary which can change during transport. Additionally a technique based on machine learning has been implemented which correctly resolves redundancy for a linear axis during planning. Finally, all components are tested on a real robot system in industrial scale. © 2017 IEEE.",cooperative manipulators; industrial robots; intelligent and flexible manufacturing; motion and path planning; robust/adaptive control of robotic systems,industrial manipulators; intelligent robots; motion planning; robot programming; automated production systems; carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; co-operating robots; collision-free paths; cooperative manipulators; intelligent and flexible manufacturing; motion and path planning; robotic systems; robust-adaptive control; robust/adaptive control of robotic systems; CFRP,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044943622

The countersinking process of the carbon fiber-reinforced plastic hole is indispensable for the assembly of countersunk head screw. In conventional countersinking process of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics, it is prone to produce the delamination, fiber pullout, poor surface levelness and dimensional accuracy of countersunk hole. As a new technology, the rotary ultrasonic elliptical machining for countersinking of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics is employed, which is a non-traditional process that can effectively improve the surface levelness, surface integrity and machining accuracy of carbon fiber-reinforced plastic countersunk hole. This article reported a feasibility study on the rotary ultrasonic elliptical machining for countersinking of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics without coolant for the first time. The processing principle of rotary ultrasonic elliptical machining for countersinking was illustrated according to the countersinking models and the equations of motion locus. Based on the principle analysis, the surface levelness, tool blades' path and countersunk hole surface morphology in rotary ultrasonic elliptical machining of the separated and unseparated types were analyzed compared to that in conventional countersinking. In addition, the rotary ultrasonic elliptical vibration transducer was designed and fabricated, as well as the experimental platform was set up. The experimental results demonstrated that the rotary ultrasonic elliptical machining achieved much better results than that in conventional countersinking, such as lower thrust force, torque, cutting temperature, better surface levelness, hole dimensional accuracy, surface integrity and chip-removal effect. The experimental results also verified the feasibility of rotary ultrasonic elliptical machining for countersinking of carbon fiber-reinforced plastics. © Institution of Mechanical Engineers 2016.",carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites; set; machining accuracy; rotary ultrasonic elliptical machining; surface integrity; surface levelness,aerospace industry; concretes; elastomer; equations of motion; Fiber reinforced plastics; fiber; fighter aircraft; machine; planning; plastic products; plastics industry; Fiber reinforced plastics; support; shear stress; ultrasonic transducers; aircraft structural components; carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites; set; experimental platform; machining accuracy; mechanical and physical properties; surface integrity; ultrasonic elliptical vibration; CFRP,"W.

Compared with the short carbon fiber which has been widely used, application of continuous carbon fiber in 3D printing can undoubtedly better play its good mechanical properties. Usually, complex parts include multiple independent contours, which lead to discontinuous paths in the 3D printing process.For the continuity characters of the continuous carbon fiber composite, it needs to be sheared off due to the discontinuous molding printing path, so as to ensure the quality of the forming process. To solve this problem, a shearing method is put forward and the shearing device is realized. Based on the 3D printing planning path by the slicing process, the actual shearing position is calculated by shearing position recognition and distance compensation between the jump and the shearing point. On the basis of this method, the corresponding shearing device is designed to build a shearing system. The accuracy and feasibility of the continuous carbon fiber shearing system is verified by simulation analysis of path jump and single-layer and multi-layer model 3D printing experiment. The method provides basis for the realization of continuous carbon fiber composites 3D printing. © 2019 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers",3d printing; continuous carbon fiber composite; discontinuous path; molding experiment; shearing systems,3d modeling; CFRP; molding; shearing; 3d printing; carbon fiber composite materials; complex construction; discontinuous path; distance compensation; position recognition; shearing systems; simulation analysis; 3d printers,"F.

Due to the continuity and infusibility of the long carbon fiber, a series of problems such as loosening of fiber, breakage, and nozzle clogging occurred in the printing process, which result in poor surface quality and performance in the printed product. This paper aims to solve these problems based on the researches and optimizations of three-dimensional printing technology for continuous CFRP composite components. Firstly, the coupling mechanism of continuous fiber and resin polymer in the flow path of nozzle is analyzed, the finite element simulation models of flow field and temperature field of CFRP three-dimensional printing are established by using ANSYS CFX software, and the coupling characteristics and interface performance in the printing process are studied. Then, based on the results of simulation analysis, a modification method of the surface coating film is applied, and a special modification solution is configured to modify the surface of the carbon fiber so as to increase its strength and bondability with the molten resin. Finally, the mechanical structure of the three-dimensional printing system of continuous CFRP components is designed to achieve the synchronization of printing and fiber modification. Considering the continuity of continuous carbon fiber, this paper proposed a new method of printing path design called ""unicursal"" for continuous CFRP parts, that is, when designing and planning a three-dimensional print path, it ensured that there is no interruption in the printing process, so as to achieve carbon fiber continuity in composite parts. The reliability and superiority of the printing system designed in this paper are confirmed by printing of the composite parts. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,CFRP; computer software; CFRP; Fiber reinforced plastics; fiber; industrial research; printing presses; resin; rocket nozzles; CFRP; coupling characteristic; design and implementations; finite element simulation model; interface performance; low cost manufacturing; mechanical structures; three-dimensional print; 3d printers,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063185197

The input cellular structure is usually represented by a graph G, and the requirements to ensure high quality manufacturing include the coverage, continuity and sharp-turning prevention of fiber deposition. To satisfy these requirements, we develop a new algorithm to search a continuous path on G's dual graph, the corresponding path on which G minimizes the total energy of tuning angles and can visit all edges of G at least once and at most twice. With the help of a post-processing algorithm, a path determined on the dual graph can be converted into an overlap-reduced toolpath for printing continuous carbon fiber. Physical tests were conducted to demonstrate the advantage of printing paths generated by our algorithm.

In this paper, we proposed a movement stability criterion, which can be used for the design, gait planning and control of a quadruped robot. Such criterion considers the geometry and mass properties (mass and mass of center) and their variation during movement, hence overcoming the shortcomings of previous works. The dynamic model is derived and the effects of the weighty leg of the total gravity center is provided. Then, the relationship between stability margin and design parameter of robot is established. As a practical application, an effective gait planning method is addressed by using the criterion. It adjusts the center of gravity to vary along desired path. Finally, a quadruped turtle robot is developed. It is composed of four 3-DOF lightweight modularized legs, an elastic neck with continuous curvature, a shell opening and closing device, a carbon fiber torso frame and control system. Based on it, some experiments are implemented to verify the proposed method. © 2016 IEEE.",,biomimetics; carbon; CFRP; machine design; multipurpose robots; robotics; automaton; stability; stability criteria; center of gravity; continuous curvature; design and application; design parameters; its applications; movement stability; quadruped robots; stability margins; robot programming,"W.

However, existing commercial digital manufacturing software only provides a few simple fiber layout algorithms, which solely use the geometry of the shape. In this work, we build an automated fiber path planning algorithm that maximizes the stiffness of a 3D print given specified external loads. We formalize this as an optimization problem: an objective function is designed to measure the stiffness of the object while regularizing certain properties of fiber paths (e.g., smoothness). To initialize each fiber path, we use finite element analysis to calculate the stress field on the object and greedily ""walk""in the direction of the stress field. We then apply a gradient-based optimization algorithm that uses the adjoint method to calculate the gradient of stiffness with respect to fiber layout. We compare our approach, in both simulation and real-world experiments, to three baselines: (1) concentric fiber rings generated by Eiger, a leading digital manufacturing software package developed by Markforged, (2) greedy extraction on the simulated stress field (i.e., our method without optimization), and (3) the greedy algorithm on a fiber orientation field calculated by smoothing the simulated stress fields. The results show that objects with fiber paths generated by our algorithm achieve greater stiffness while using less fiber than the baselines - our algorithm improves the Pareto frontier of object stiffness as a function of fiber usage. Ablation studies show that the smoothing regularizer is needed for feasible fiber paths and stability of optimization, and multi-resolution optimization helps reduce the running time compared to single-resolution optimization. © 2023 Owner/Author.",3d printing; continuous fibers; end-to-end differentiable; optimization; path planning method,3d printing; CFRP; computer software; optimization; stiffness; stress; 3d printing; 3d printing; continuous fibers; digital manufacturing; end to end; end-to-end differentiable; fiber path; manufacturing software; optimization; stress field; motion planning,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180125015

The manipulator is composed of a three degree of freedom Cartesian motion system, which resides outside the gantry of the scanner, and serves as the holder and global positioner of a three degree of freedom arm which extends inside the gantry of the scanner. At its distal end, the arm's end-effector can carry an interventional tool such as a biopsy needle, which can be advanced to a desired depth by means of a seventh degree of freedom. These seven degrees of freedom, provided by the entire assembly, offer extended manipulability to the device and a wide envelope of operation to the user, who can select a trajectory suitable for the procedure. The device is constructed of nonmagnetic and nonconductive fiberglass, and carbon fiber composite materials, to minimize artifacts and distortion on the MR images as well as eliminate effects on its operation from the high magnetic field and the fast switching magnetic field gradients used in MR imaging. A user interface was developed for man-in-the-loop control of the device using real-time MR images. The user interface fuses all sensor signals (MR and manipulator information) in a visualization, planning, and control command environment. Path planning is performed with graphical tools for setting the trajectory of insertion of the interventional tool using multislice and/or three dimensional MR images which are refreshed in real time. The device control is performed with an embedded computer which runs real-time control software. The manipulator compatibility with the MR environment and image-guided operation was tested on a 1.5 T MR scanner.

The aim is to optimally match the concrete paths and reinforcement arrangement to the compression and tension trajectories. Typically, 3D printers can control three axes, which means that the material is built up in horizontal layers. In 3D concrete printing, this restricts the integration of reinforcement, as well as the integration of other component functions. The novel approach uses the spatial freedom of the robot-assisted SC3DP technology. The planning of the concrete paths is adjusted to the integration of the reinforcement during the printing process (concrete supports reinforcement). By curving the concrete pathways threedimensionally, the reinforcement can be optimally arranged along the tensile stress trajectories, without additional support reinforcement for positioning. In this paper, the novel approach is demonstrated on a single span beam under uniform loading. Cut carbon fibre fabrics are used as reinforcement. The paper gives an overview of the used machine setup, technical parameters and abilities of the combined technologies. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",additive manufacturing (am); automation in construction; robotic fabrication; robotic path planning; shotcrete 3d printing; structural design,,"R.

These types of materials can be stronger than steel, about 40% lighter than aluminium, up to 80% lighter than steel and as stiff as titanium. Composite materials represent a good alternative to engineering materials, providing several important advantages in comparison to conventional materials, such as: light weight, mechanical and chemical resistance, low maintenance costs, high specific strength, higher stiffness and temperature stability, allowance of free forms modelling and specific design. Surface roughness evaluation is very important for many fundamental problems such as friction, contact deformation, heat and electric current conduction, tightness of contact joints and positional accuracy. For this reason, surface roughness, has been the subject of experimental and theoretical investigations for many decades. Also, surface roughness imposes one of the most critical constrains for the selection of machines and cutting parameters in process planning. In order to economically machine these materials with high part qualities, improvements in machining strategies must be made. This chapter presents the researches regarding different milling and drilling strategies in order to determine the best quality of the finished product.

To establish the optimized stellarator as a serious candidate for a fusion reactor, reactor-relevant dimensionless plasma parameters must be achieved in fully integrated steady-state scenarios. After more than 10 years of construction time, the completion of the device is now approaching rapidly (mid-2014). We discuss the most important lessons learned during the device assembly and first experiences with coming major work packages. Those are (a) assembly of about 2500 large, water-cooled, 3d-shaped in-vessel component elements; (b) assembly of in total 14 superconducting current leads, one pair for each coil type; and (c) assembly of the device periphery including diagnostics and heating systems. In the second part we report on the present status of planning for the first operation phase (5-10 s discharge duration at 8 MW heating power), the completion and hardening of the device for full power steady-state operation, and the second operation phase (up to 30 min discharge duration at 10 MW heating power). It is the ultimate goal of operation phase one to develop credible and robust discharge scenarios for the high-power steady-state operation phase two. Beyond the improved equilibrium, confinement, and stability properties owing to stellarator optimization, this requires density control, impurity control, edge iota control as well as high density microwave heating. Of paramount importance is the operation of the island divertor, which is realized in the first operation phase as an inertially cooled conventional graphite target divertor. It will be replaced later on by the steady-state capable island divertor with its water-cooled carbon fiber reinforced carbon target elements. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.

In order to improve the printing efficiency of carbon fiber 3D printing technology, it has been expanded to four side-by-side nozzles based on traditional single nozzles, and four nozzles are bound to print side by side. The four-nozzle side-by-side printing path has the problem of coordinating the motion planning of each nozzle, controlling the squeezing difference of each nozzle, and adjusting the angle of the print head, so it is necessary to reasonably control the squeezing amount of each nozzle and the angle of the print head. After the slicing processing based on the existing model, the Gcode code of the model is obtained. The Gcode code of the model is processed through the multi-tow continuous carbon fiber 3D printing path planning algorithm. The movement trajectory of each nozzle of the printer is reasonably planned based on the outer wall coordinates and the extrusion amount of each nozzle is controlled. Finally, the snipping instruction is executed after a circle of trajectory to print the next layer of motion trajectory, which ultimately improves the 3D printing while ensuring the accuracy of multi-beam model 3D printing. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,3d modeling; 3d printing; CFRP; corrosion resistance; glass ceramics; high temperature corrosion; molten materials; motion planning; thermal conductivity; trajectory; 3d printing; 3d printing; carbon fiber composite materials; friction resistance; high temperature resistance; high-temperature resistance; path method; print head; resistance friction; side by sides; nozzle,"F.

They are a promising option for producing individual parts or small lot sizes without the need for expensive molds and can thus revolutionize the creation of patient-tailored prosthetics or high-end sports equipment. In this paper, the combination of robotic singlepoint incremental forming of carbon fiber-reinforced organo sheets with carbon fiber-reinforced 3D printing is presented. Combining those dieless processes in a novel process chain, complex parts with different geometric features could be produced without the need for adhesives or fasteners. The developed method begins with designing the desired component in CAD and its division into sections to be formed incrementally and sections to be 3D printed. For incremental forming, an organo sheet is cut to the necessary shape, sandwiched between a layup of dummy metal sheets, fixed on a clamping frame, and heated to the required forming temperature. Path planning for the robot is carried out based on a selected forming strategy, and the sheet is formed. Afterward, the part is transferred and fixed onto a robotic experimental 3D printing setup. The part\x92s surface is 3D-scanned to provide the basis for the path planning algorithm. The slicer software generates non-planar layers based on the actual shape of the formed sheet and the desired geometry of the printed part section. After slicing, the code for the robot is generated and the print job is executed. Within this paper, the conceptualized process chain is presented and basic functionality is proven by manufacturing a demonstration part. The first results are promising to enable efficient manufacturing of complex components that combine different geometric features in small batch sizes. Future research will be conducted to analyze and optimize the process chain and its capabilities, especially regarding the resulting part quality.  © 2025 The Author(s).",additive manufacturing (am); carbon fiber reinforced components; incremental sheet forming,melt spinning; metal forming; sporting goods; 3d printing; 3d printing; carbon fiber reinforced components; carbon fiber reinforced components; die-less process; geometric feature; incremental forming; incremental sheet forming; process chain; reinforced components; CFRP,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-105000016454

To resolve this issue, a novel interface temperature control method characterized by staged laser path planning is proposed. The maximum temperature that the workpiece has experienced and will experience is used as the basis for path planning. Subsequently, constrained by the melting and decomposition temperatures of the thermoplastic composite, a reciprocating laser path with adjustable reversing positions is planned to preheat the initial joining area. For the subsequent area, an adaptive fusing path is obtained by analyzing the relationship between the interface temperature distribution and the set temperature conditions. The results of validation experiment suggest that the temperature control method is suitable for various geometries, and it also ensures that the interface temperature difference consistently remains within 80 ℃, which is significantly lower than the temperature difference of hundreds of degrees Celsius under the path, where the influences of heat accumulation and thermal boundary conditions on the joining temperature is not considered. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",aluminum alloys; carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite; interface temperature control; laser direct joining; path planning method,aluminum alloys; Fiber reinforced plastics; joining; motion planning; support; thermoplastic; carbon fiber reinforced components; carbon fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite; direct joining; fiber reinforced thermoplastics; heat accumulation; interface temperature control; interface temperatures; laser direct joining; laser paths; reinforced thermoplastic composites; temperature control,"B.-Y.

In order to realize the automatic placement of carbon fiber components with large curvature and small size, this article adopts the carbon fiber patch placement method to make the preforms. By combining the surface subdivision method and the finite element optimization method of carbon fiber patch placement angle, a discrete path planning method of robotic carbon fiber patch is proposed. This method divides the complex surface into surface fragments with similar curvature and normal angle, which can effectively reduce the wrinkles in the process of carbon fiber patch placement and improve the utilization of carbon fiber patch. At the same time, the stiffness optimization design of carbon fiber patch composite preforming is realized by combining the finite element optimization method of placement angle. The helmet surface was selected as the research object of carbon fiber placement path planning, and the path planning of helmet surface placement was carried out, and the simulation tests of helmet placement in different regions and overall placement were compared.

Proposed in this paper is an experimental study on the effect of several different path planning placements on the mechanical behavior of laminated materials. The prepreg selected for the experiment was high-strength toughened epoxy resin T300 carbon fiber prepreg UH3033-150. The composite laminates with variable angles were prepared by an eight-tow seven-axis linkage laying machine. After the curing process, the composite laminates were conducted by tensile and bending test separately. The test results show that there exists an optimal planning path among these for which the tensile strength of the laminated specimens decreases slightly by only 3.889%, while the bending strength increases greatly by 16.68%. It can be found that for the specific planning path placement, the bending strength of the composite laminates is significantly improved regardless of the little difference in tensile strength, which shows the importance of path planning and this may be used as a guideline for future AFP process. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the chemical inertness and high viscosity of carbon fibres and resins render them susceptible to severe interfacial bonding problems and printing defects. The optimisation of materials and processes represents an efficacious methodology for the pursuit of improvement. Therefore, this study aimed to improve the mechanical properties of CCF-reinforced thermoplastic polyurethane (CCF/TPU) material system by optimising printing process parameters, path planning and proposing a novel wet-twist treatment strategy. The failure behaviour was further investigated and the mechanisms to improve CCF impregnation, reduce defects and enhance interfacial bonding were analysed. The findings revealed that the failure behaviour at optimum printing parameters was fibre breakage. The wet twisting process effectively improves the impregnation of CCF by TPU and imparts a macroscopic helical morphology to CCF, eliminating weak fibre knots. The tensile strength and modulus of elasticity of the optimised printed parts were significantly increased by 62.18 % and 87.16 %. This provides a feasible way to improve the mechanical properties of CFRP and broaden the application scenarios. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",3d printing; continuous carbon fiber 3d printing; mechanical properties; process parameter optimisation; wet twisting treatment,,"W.

One key contributor to the rapid manufacturing rate of the CF-TPC is its weldability that allows the reduction or even elimination of time-consuming adhesive bonding and or mechanical fastening. Induction is a rapid heating method for welding of unidirectional tape or fabric based CF-TPC parts. However, to date, there are no mature solutions available for large, curved, varying thickness parts such as engine nacelle fan cowls and aircraft fuselage panels/barrels. The objective of this work is to develop a robotic cell that is capable of automatically navigating along the weld-line of a large composite part with in-situ sensing and control to significantly reduce the part specific induction welding (IW) process implementation. Robotic automation is required for safe, reliable, and efficient IW of large CF-TPC components in production-level environments. Technologies developed in this work include robotic IW cell configuration, end effector design, tool path planning, sensing, in-situ control, and the human machine interface (HMI). This development culminated with a demonstration of IW a simplified skin-stiffened aircraft component. Copyright 2022.

However, state-of-the-art entails fiber orientations be specified manually during the slicing and infill planning steps without any awareness of the desired material properties. In this paper, we formulate and solve the continuous fiber infilling with additively manufactured parts as a fiber path planning problem with constraints on the desired minimum fiber-volume fraction and optimal fiber orientations. The autonomous path planner maximizes the fiber-volume fraction in areas requiring high stiffness while minimizing the continuous-carbon filament in the rest of the part. The fiber orientation is also optimized to maximize the use of continuous carbon filaments. The software tools for generating continuous carbon fiber infills packaged with commercial composite 3D printers cannot automatically satisfy machine-imposed constraints, and the user is often asked to provide the infill geometries manually. The algorithms presented in this paper consider the geometry, stiffness requirements, and printing device constraints while formulating the infill structure. The algorithm was implemented into an open-source parametric 3D modeler. The implementation imports the mesh file representing the solid geometry, cleans and repairs the mesh, calculates the space between faces, and slices the part. Before creating the infill path, the algorithm obtains the face and hole contours and establishes the continuous carbon infill regions. The continuous carbon fiber placement paths are then determined within the infill region to maximize the fiber volume fraction while satisfying the machine constraints. The paper describes solutions with continuous fiber infilling using several example part geometries. © 2023 by DEStech Publications, Inc. and American Society for Composites.

First, laying angles and center angles were obtained based on a prepreg tape laying path model. A differential geometric solution was applied to transition from dynamic to static coordinates based on the center angle, enabling calculation of the paving pose. Second, the convergence speed and calculation accuracy were enhanced by refining the original snake optimization algorithm and incorporating it into the inverse kinematics of the laying robot. Inverse kinematics was employed to obtain the joint angles of the front seven axes of the laying robot from the laying pose. Matching the joint angles to the center angles effectively suppressed slippage at the end of the placement head. Finally, simulations and experiments were conducted on in-situ molding of ellipsoid shell tow laying. The results demonstrate no occurrences of slippage or wrinkles during the in-situ molding experiment involving the laying out of tows for unequal pole hole shells. The laying pose accuracy reaches 10−16, meeting the precision requirements for in-situ molding pose of tow laying, thus making it suitable for practical applications in tow laying in-situ molding work. © 2024 Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics (BUAA).

The currently-applied steps within the manufacturing pipeline, such as slicing and path planning, consider only the planar case of filament deposition and mostly make no use of the possibility to place single pre-impregnated (prepreg) filaments. Classical methods such as tape-laying and laminating struggle with highly curved and complex geometries and require the costly production of molds, whereas when using AM, these geometries can be realized more easily and molds can be created using the same process. In this paper, a set of algorithms is presented that aims to resolve these problems. Criteria are formulated which enable the goal oriented development and evaluation of the presented methods and represent metrics for future methods. The developed algorithms enable the use of both continuous and discontinuous fiber patches in a much wider range of applications in designing and manufacturing of CFRPs. This opens up new possibilities in this promising field. The developed metrics and infrastructure further constitute progress in the field of multi-axis non-planar path planning for slicing algorithms in general and the conducted evaluation proves the formal applicability of the developed algorithms. © 2022 by the authors.

The aim is to enable load-bearing connections and realize crossings of fibers by generating layer specific patterns. As input we use a graph representation of the structural design with given desired continuous fiber connections. From this, optimal fiber patterns are obtained for each printing layer by solving linear integer optimization problems. Each layer may have a unique solution based on the history of the previous layers. Additionally, a path planning approach is presented which interprets the obtained layers via curves based on quadratic and cubic Bézier splines and their offset curves in constant distance. The single parameter for the construction of the paths is the minimal turning radius of the fibers. The path planning provides a new interpretation for the final geometry of the design to be printed. With the novel approach presented, for a given design, continuous print paths are automatically generated across multiple print layers, respecting manufacturing constraints (parallel paths, minimum turning radius, no crossings), with the goal of achieving the best mechanical properties. This is an important tool to generate printing machine control from a given design description to print high performance parts. The multilayer patterns are a significant improvement over conventional single-layer print path layout methods. © 2025 The Authors",3d printing; c-cfrtp; CFRP,CFRP; integer linear programming; integer programming; layered manufacturing; mixed-integer linear programming; offset printing; printing presses; spline; 3d printing; 3d printing; c-cfrtp; carbon fiber reinforced components; fiber patterns; fiber reinforced thermoplastics; multi-layers; pattern optimization; toolpaths; turning radius; motion planning,"F.

The Paris Agreement which marks the agreement of all countries on low-carbon transition aims to limit the global temperature increase to 2 ℃ in this century while seeking measures to further limit the temperature increase to 1. 5 ℃ and in response countries around the world are actively exploring low-carbon strategies and planning carbon reduction pathways. The goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2060 is a requirement for all industries in China to develop corresponding carbon-neutral pathways as soon as possible. Carbon neutrality means that the carbon emissions from all activities within the selected system boundary can be offset with the carbon absorbed through natural or artificial means i. e. the carbon footprint is zero. There are photosynthetic and soil carbon sequestration activities during natural fibers' raw material acquisition stage which may be of some value to the carbon neutrality of the textile and apparel industry. However because the biochemical reactions involved in this stage are more complex compared to industrial processing operations there are still divergent opinions on the methods of accounting for its carbon footprint which brings obstacles to the evaluation of the carbon effect of natural fibers in the raw material acquisition stage and even in the whole life cycle. To grasp the progress of research on the carbon effect of natural fibers in the raw material acquisition stage and analyze the existing problems so as to help promote a more accurate and comprehensive carbon footprint accounting and carbon effect evaluation of natural fibers cotton hemp silk and wool are selected as the research objects and the current situation of carbon effect evaluation of the above four typical natural fibers in this stage is discussed by defining the scope of the raw material acquisition stage of natural fibers. The analysis of the literature shows that the research on the carbon absorption of natural fibers is insufficient compared with the research on carbon emission at the stage of raw material acquisition and the following points can be improved in subsequent related studies according to this paper (i) the definition of relevant terminology is not clear (ii) the accounting results lack comparability due to the inconsistency of the system boundary and accounting methods chosen by the existing research and the quality of production activity data is difficult to be guaranteed (iii) there are commonalities and differences in the growth characteristics and carbon transfer paths of various types of natural fibers at the stage of raw material acquisition and a universal theoretical model has not yet been concluded for this point iv the influence of the time factor on the results in carbon footprint accounting has not yet been agreed. In response to the above problems this paper compares the international standards and reports with high recognition in recent years and standardizes a section of terms for the study of carbon effect in the raw material stage of natural fibers then the carbon transfer pathways of two major classifications of natural fibers i. e. cellulose fibers and protein fibers are summarized in this stage which provides references for building theoretical models in addition the influence of time factors on the evaluation results of carbon effect is discussed in terms of the time boundary of the global warming potential GWP and the short-term carbon storage time of natural fiber garments. Exploring the carbon neutral path in the textile and apparel industry requires both verifying the industry's carbon emissions as well as recognizing the industry's carbon absorptions and trying to offset carbon emissions with natural carbon sinks to reduce carbon neutral costs. This paper discusses some of the problems and solution ideas for the evaluation of carbon effect at the stage of natural fiber raw material acquisition which can provide a reference for improving the carbon footprint accounting at this stage and help achieve a more comprehensive and accurate assessment of the carbon effect of natural fibers. © 2023 China Silk Association.

The prevalence of complex curved surfaces in the industry provides significant motivation for the use of 6 axis robots for deployment of NDT probes in these inspections. A new system for robot deployed ultrasonic inspection of composite aerospace components is presented. The key novelty of the approach is through the accommodation of flexible robotic trajectory planning, coordinated with the NDT data acquisition. Using a flexible approach in MATLAB, the authors have developed a high level custom toolbox that utilizes external control of an industrial 6 axis manipulator to achieve complex path planning and provide synchronization of the employed ultrasonic phase array inspection system. The developed software maintains a high level approach to the robot programming, in order to ease the programming complexity for an NDT inspection operator. Crucially the approach provides a pathway for a conditional programming approach and the capability for multiple robot control (a significant limitation in many current off-line programming applications). Ultrasonic and experimental data has been collected for the validation of the inspection technique. The path trajectory generation for a large, curved carbon-fiber-reinforced polymer (CFRP) aerofoil component has been proven and is presented. The path error relative to a raster-scan tool-path, suitable for ultrasonic phased array inspection, has been measured to be within + 2mm over the 1.6 m                             2                              area of the component surface.                          © 2015 American Institute of Physics.",,,,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063820427

However, the manual process of creating a preform out of dry cut-outs is still very time-consuming and error-prone and thus limits an efficient use of this technology. Especially the high diversity of variants, the material properties and the complexity of the process limited an automation of the preforming process so far. In this paper an automation system is presented, which consists of a robot-based preforming end-effector and its offline path-planning. The end-effector has a highly modular and flexible design and integrates the three essential functions of the preforming process: gripping, draping and heating. Based on a detailed analysis of the geometric parameters of the preforms and its layers the task-specific layout of the end-effector is conducted. To achieve a preform in high-quality a solution for controlling the end-effector and planning the robot-path is necessary. Hence, a semi-automatic approach is developed, which incorporates the know-how of experts and automatically generates layup-curves with path-synchronous trigger signals for the end-effector. In an experimental set up the feasibility and flexibility of the automation solution could be successfully tested. The evaluation on three industrial moulds showed that the challenging requirements and the high quality standards could be met. © 2014, German Academic Society for Production Engineering (WGP).",assembly; automation; complex; end-effector; limp material; preform,automation; CFRP; complex; plastic; aerospace applications; assembly; automation; CFRP; composite materials; plastics applications; preform; quality control; robot programming; technology transfer; automation solutions; automation systems; composite industrys; experimental set up; high-quality standards; offline path planning; preforming process; synchronous triggers; end effectors,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84910014518

Several research papers on carbon fiber reinforced composites, used carbon fiber tows directly or sized carbon fibers as reinforcement for the composite, which is time consuming and not reliable as frequent clogging occurs. This paper presents a simple method by introducing the novel use of twisted carbon fiber filament and analyze its effect on the additive manufactured composites. The matrix material used is PLA. The commercially available 3D printers for printing continuous fibers, use double nozzle setups for printing the matrix and reinforcement separately in a layer by layer manner. However, there are no reports on the use of twisted continuous carbon fiber as filament and its effect on the printed parts. This paper uses twisted carbon fibers with single nozzle setup such that the material coming out of the nozzle will be ready to use CCF-PLA composite. Thus, the need of separate stacking of each layer of the matrix and fiber can be avoided. A separate path process planning has been done for printing the twisted carbon fibers in consideration of its continuity and the anisotropy. Standard mechanical tests are conducted, and the morphological study of the composite is done. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and review of the challenges associated with enhancing mechanical properties stemming from interfacial bonding issues and pore defects in 3D-printed CCFRTP parts. Specifically, this study thoroughly examines the properties and modification techniques pertinent to two critical constituents of printing materials: the resin matrix and carbon fiber reinforcement. It also explores advancements in FFF printing equipment specifically designed for CCFRTP components, alongside current developments in related impregnation processes. Furthermore, this work introduces an evolution in continuum path planning grounded in principles of structural lightweight design while applying topology optimization to create anisotropic CCFRTP structures. The influence of various printing process parameters on mechanical properties is analyzed systematically; additionally, processing strategies that incorporate auxiliary reinforcement techniques—such as thermopressure, negative pressure, laser application, magnetic fields, microwave energy, and infrared radiation—are emphasized. The mechanical behavior is meticulously tracked throughout the study, while corresponding failure mechanisms are scrutinized through recent advancements in characterization methods aimed at visualizing void defects. We critically assess the existing technological challenges that impede the 3D printing of CCFRTPs and propose potential future research directions intended to inspire further exploration within this promising field. Highlights: Optimizing the CCFRTP interface hinges on material matching and synergistic CCF mods. CF continuity and anisotropy demand refined print/impregnation design and algorithm. Stress-guided path planning with topo optimization unveils innovative potential. Optimized print parameters and ancillary processes facilitate enhanced performance. 3D characterization ensures reliable material void and process defect assessment. © 2025 Society of Plastics Engineers.",3d printing; continuous carbon fiber 3d printing; failure analysis; performance enhancements; thermoplastic polymers,compressive strength; crack; elastomer; electrospinning; fracture mechanics; glue; hydroelasticity; impregnation; ionomers; layered manufacturing; plastic filaments; silicone; thermoplastic; 3d printing; 3d printing; carbon fiber reinforced components; continuous carbon fiber 3d printing; fiber reinforced thermoplastics; mechanical; performance enhancements; polymer components; property; thermoplastic polymers; CFRP,"W.

This encompasses the complete life cycle of buildings, from the construction phase to service life to component disposal. The main source of emissions of climate-damaging greenhouse gases such as CO2, with a share of 9% of global emissions, is the production of ordinary cement as the main binder of concrete. The use of innovative approaches such as impregnated carbon yarns as non-corrosive reinforcement embedded in concrete has the potential to dramatically reduce the amount of concrete required in construction, since no excessive concrete cover is needed to protect against corrosion, as is the case with steel reinforcement. At the same time, architectural design options are expanded via this approach. This is achieved above all using novel robotic manufacturing technologies to enable no-cut direct fiber placement. This innovative technological approach to fabricating 2D and 3D biologically inspired textiles, including non-metallic structures for textile-reinforced concrete (TRC) components, will promote an automatable construction method that reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Furthermore, the impregnated yarn which is fabricated enables the production of load-adapted and gradual non-metallic reinforcement components. Novel and improved design strategies with innovative reinforcement patterns allow the full mechanical potential of TRC to be realized. The development of a robotic fabrication technology has gone beyond the state of the art to implement spatially branched, biologically inspired 3D non-metallic reinforcement structures. A combined robotic fabrication technology, based on the developed flexible 3D yarn-guiding and impregnation module and a 3D yarn fixation module, is required to implement this sophisticated approach to fabricate freely formed 3D non-metallic reinforcement structures. This paper presents an overview of the development process of the innovative technological concept. © 2023 by the authors.",automated path planning; carbon fiber heavy tows; coreless robotic winding; non-metallic reinforcement; robot-assisted yarn deposition; textile-reinforced concrete,biomimetics; carbon dioxide lasers; construction industry; fabrication; gas emissions; greenhouse gases; industrial emissions; life cycle; motion planning; concretes; robot programming; steel corrosion; steel fibers; textile industry; wool; automated path planning; automated path planning; carbon fiber heavy tows; coreless robotic winding; coreless robotic winding; metallic reinforcements; non-metallic reinforcement; non-metallic reinforcement; robot-assisted yarn deposition; textile reinforced concretes; narration,"D.

In this type of process, hundreds of textile blanks with different contours are stored in a tool mould. For large components such as an aircraft fuselage, it is also necessary to transport the flexible blanks with cooperating robots. For this purpose, a system was developed which allows to generate robot paths on the basis of Computer Aided Design (CAD) data, which is automatically extended by information such as pickup and drop points for the robot. The system has already been successfully tested with sampling-based algorithms on a robot system with two KUKA KR210 R3100 robots on a common linear axis. However, the use of sampling-based algorithms a heuristic must be developed to solve the redundancy of linear axis which is usually only functional for the current scenario and must be adapted for another one. Evolutionary algorithms offer the advantage that they are also able to find a solution for the linear axis independent of the scenario. In this work. A path planning system that uses evolutionary algorithms to calculate collision-free paths reliably for cooperating robots on a common linear axis will be presented. © 2018 The Authors.",cooperating robots; evolutionary algorithms; path planning method; sampling-based algorithm,,"J.

To achieve this aircraft manufacturers increase the usage of high performance, lightweight materials such as carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRP). At the moment production needs a lot of manual steps. However the airplane structures to be built e.g. a fuselage, are up to 30m long. It is strongly recommended to automate these processes. To build these parts automatically the German Aerospace Center (DLR) has developed and built a large (30m × 15m × 7 m) robotic facility where multiple robots which move on linear axes share the same workspace.

It has been used for the flagship Manatee project to develop 3 stacked reservoirs, which will be one of the largest projects in Shell Trinidad and Tobago (STT). Gas from these wells is expected to be processed via a new platform and transported via a long offshore pipeline pipeline to the Beachfield onshore facility. The DT was used to identify design modifications required at this onshore site and visualize the proposed offshore assets. It integrates existing facilities and new design data, including site survey, subsurface and wells data to optimize the well planning. With access to an integrated visualization platform for both surface and subsurface 3D and 4D data and engineering design documentation, virtual site visits were conducted to assess the existing facility. Integrating the 3D model with the pipelines, bathymetry data of the proposed pipeline routes and subsurface data, the team was able to design and engineer future upgrades required for the upcoming development. Furthermore, DT was used to visualize the proposed well paths, platform design, rig access and subsurface reservoir data which supported platform location, layout, and orientation decisions. The full project scope, in the form of a complete 3D model was created for both onshore and offshore assets. DT allowed the teams to have a better understanding of the site layout and area constraints that would have been impossible to envisage using 2D drawings alone. The proposed models assisted with identifying possible design issues, thus reducing the likelihood of errors and lowering costs associated with rework and corrections. The teams used high-resolution photogrammetry to support the environmental team in determining the best landing site for the pipeline and fiber optic cable. This was done by navigating through bathymetry and geohazards to land the new pipeline route from the platform to Beachfield. Overall, access to a digital representation of the facilities, led to a significant manhour saving for the teams, enabling integrated, efficient working and improved decision quality. Overall, the use of the DT has been estimated to deliver direct cost savings of several millions per year and generate double digits millions of indirect value from safety design and rework during project decision gates handover and project schedule integration. Furthermore, given the limitations due to the pandemic, CO2 emissions and the carbon footprint were lowered as there was a reduced number of helicopter flights offshore and drives towards the onshore facilities.

Grid-stiffened composites are one of the applications that prized for their high specific stiffness and buckling resistance. However, the discrepancies between design and manufacturing and their influence on the properties of as-fabricated structures are often insufficiently considered. Herein, the manufacturing discrepancies are taken into account during the design stage by developing a novel path-planning approach specifically tailored for FRPC 3D printing of grid-stiffened composite structures with curved stiffeners. Firstly, an Euler graph-based technique is applied to obtain continuous paths that are well aligned with curved stiffeners and possess minimum fiber cutting frequency and printing time. These continuous paths are further optimized for buckling resistance using inexpensive yet accurate updated finite element models. These computational models are coupled with experimental characterization results to provide evaluations that consider manufacturing imperfections and as-fabricated properties. Within this performance-aware process, buckling resistance is optimized based on a fixed input geometry, with joint configurations as variables. Finally, the proposed path-planning approach is experimentally validated and proven to be effective in integrating performance considerations into both the design and manufacturing stages, leading to a more efficient and performance-optimized fabrication process for grid-stiffened composite structures. © 2024 The Society of Manufacturing Engineers",buckling analysis; frpc 3d printing; grid-stiffened composite structures; manufacturing efficiency; performance-aware path planning,buckle; CFRP; graphic methods; motion planning; structural design; structure (composition); 3d printing; 3d printing; buckling analysis; fiber reinforced polymer composites; fiber-reinforced polymer composite 3d printing; grid-stiffened composite structures; manufacturing efficiency; performance; performance-aware path planning; stiffened composite structure; 3d printing,"Y.

Such plates are extensively used in the aerospace, instrumental, and military fields. However, some problems, such as high reflectivity, serious oxidation of the oxygen-assisted cutting surface, and large seam widths after cutting, can be observed when cutting 1-mm-thick copper-steel laminated plates with a fiber laser. Although some solution methods have been proposed in the existing researches, the protection of the original properties of the material surface, the processing precision, and the product processing technologies are still limited. The effects of lasers and materials can be improved using the pretreatment method proposed in this study, in which the element compositions, morphologies, and physicochemical properties of processing areas are adjusted to ensure processing quality, expand the processing range of a 1064 nm fiber laser, and design the experiment for processing slit gratings. The feasibility of this method is verified. Methods: Based on the analysis of the material properties and the laser processing characteristics, a shallow melting surface could be obtained by controlling the energy input. The plate surface was scanned using a low-power fiber laser by considering oxygen as the auxiliary gas to obtain morphology changes and material properties conducive to laser processing. The processing quality of this method is compared with those of other methods. A three-dimensional (3D) microscope was used to observe and measure the surface morphology, heat-affected zone (HAZ), and slit width. In addition, the Plus software was used to estimate the oxide distribution in the shallow melting area formed by pretreatment. Thus, the proportion of oxide area in the shallow melting area could be calculated. The surface roughness was measured using a Keynes laser confocal microscope. Further, the surface morphological changes in the shallow melting area were analyzed to investigate the influence of pretreatment on laser absorption and subsequent processing. The advantages of this method with respect to quality and technology were deduced via experiments in which different pretreatment methods were used. After reasonable processing parameters were obtained, the slit grating was processed by planning the processing path, and the deformation and accuracy were controlled within the required range. Results and Discussions: In this study, the plate surface is guided to obtain shallow melting and black oxide via pretreatment. The width of shallow melting on the material surface is smaller than the spot diameter, and the oxide and molten substance overlap with each other. Therefore, the main energy absorption area with respect to the spot diameter is segmented and reduced, and black oxide can effectively improve the laser absorption rate. Thus, the problem of low laser absorptivity on the surface of the copper-steel laminated plates can be solved and the appropriate energy utilization can be achieved. Hence, most of them are used to remove the materials within the irradiation range and reduce heat accumulation at the edge of the slit. The slit width is smaller than the spot diameter, and the HAZ of the slit is reduced. Thus, the cut accuracy and quality of the laser-cut copper-steel laminated plates are improved when the proposed pretreatment method is applied. Through pretreatment, a pretreated surface containing 36.54%77.84% of oxidation area can be obtained. The larger the proportion of the oxidation area, the lesser is the amount of oxide copper spots in the shallow melting zone, the greater is the density of the molten pool, and the more uniform is the edge line. Compared with that of the oxygen-assisted cutting method, the seam width of the pretreatment method decreases by approximately 45% and that of the carbon black coating method decreases by 36%. Conclusions: The material surface melts in the form of a shallow layer when the energy density is controlled and the oxidation reaction is guided. The width of shallow melting on the material surface is smaller than the spot diameter. Compared with other methods, the material around the slit is not affected by oxidation or pollution before and after processing. Compared with other methods, the laser pretreatment method achieves a better cutting quality and requires shorter time. By conducting the complete experiment with respect to two factors and three levels, a pretreated surface in agreement with the shallow melting state can be obtained. In this treatment range, the processing parameters are selected based on the proportion of oxidation area to perform the cutting experiment, and the grating sample is produced. The results show that a slit grating satisfying all the quality requirements can be obtained using the proposed method. Further, the HAZ is considerably smaller after cutting, and there is no slag on the back. The properties of copper cladding before and after cutting are protected to ensure that the quality of the copper-steel laminated plates cut by the fiber laser meets the application requirements. © 2021, Chinese Lasers Press.

In the face grinding process of CFRP circular cell honeycomb, regular burrs are easy to appear and the formation process of burrs is not clear. CFRP circular cell of honeycomb is studied, the exit angle and the grinding wheel axis offset angle is defined considering its macro structural features and face grinding characteristics. Furthermore, the interaction between grinding wheel and fiber in cutting section is systematically studies under the comprehensive influence of chamfered corner of grinding wheel and machining parameters is revealed and the prediction model of burr length is established. The results show that the chamfered corner of grinding wheel in the cutting section is affected by the grinding wheel axis offset angle and the chamfered corner of grinding wheel simultaneously, the position where the fiber breaks first is affected by the relationship between the chamfered corner of grinding wheel in the cutting section and the fiber direction angle and the axial grinding depth, the length of the burr is affected by the position where the fiber breaks first and the fiber direction angle. Meanwhile, in order to obtain better machined surface quality and avoid burr, the grinding wheel with larger chamfer angle and smaller grinding wheel axis offset angle or the exit angle close to 90° are preferred. When burr is unavoidable, smaller grinding axial depth is preferred. The research results can provide guidance for tool path planning, tool design and process parameter selection in the grinding process of CFRP circular cell honeycomb. © 2022 Editorial Office of Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering.

Since the material is very expensive, costs have to be saved through an automated production. For the manufacturing of large structures it is often advisable to use cooperating robots. However, a major problem for the economic use of complex components is the programming of the robot paths. Manual teach-in is no feasible solution and therefore often decides if automated production is profitable.

Although the main advantage of 3D printing is that complex shapes can be produced through a simple process, very few studies have evaluated samples with complex shapes containing continuous fibers. Unlike pure resin or materials mixed with short fibers, carbon fiber filament contains long, strong fibers, which requires additional steps such as cutting the filament multiple times to create complex shapes. This study proposes a path planning algorithm for the print head of a fused deposition modeling (FDM) 3D printer using filaments reinforced with continuous fiber bundle. The proposed method generates a single-stroke path that can be printed continuously without cutting the filament for each layer. Specifically, an Eulerian graph is created from the print pattern, and the path is generated using Hierholzer's Algorithm with constraints. By visualizing the generated paths, we confirmed that the paths generated by the proposed method do not interfere with each other. Furthermore, samples were fabricated by using a 3D printer capable of printing with continuous fibers, and the inside of these samples were observed with X-ray computed tomography (CT). In addition, the gaps that occur during actual printing can be suppressed by adjusting the parameters of the algorithm. Finally, we have shown that the proposed method can be applied to geometries with varying wall thicknesses and aperiodic patterns using the Voronoi diagram. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",3d printing; cellular structures; continuous carbon fibers; lightweight structures; path planning method,CFRP; computerized tomography; fused deposition modeling; motion planning; printing presses; Fiber reinforced plastics; thermoplastic; three dimensional computer graphics; 3d printing; 3d printing; carbon fiber reinforced components; cellular structures; complex shapes; continuous carbon fiber 3d printing; continuous fibers; lightweight structures; path-planning algorithm; single stroke; support,"K.

One of the key components of the CO2 Sequestration Project is to have a site-specific, risk-based and adaptive Monitoring, Measurement and Verification (MMV) plan. The storage site has been studied thoroughly and is understood to be inherently safe for CO2 sequestration. However, it is incumbent on operator to manage and minimize storage risks. MMV planning is critical along with geological site selection, transportation and storage process. Geological evaluation study of the storage site suggests the containment capacity of identified large depleted gas reservoirs as well as long term conformance due to thick interval. The fault-seal analysis and reservoir integrity study contemplate long-term security of the CO2 storage. An integrated 3D reservoir dynamic simulation model coupled with geomechanical and geochemical models were performed. This helps in understanding storage capacity, trapping mechanisms, reservoir integrity, plume migration path, and injectivity. To demonstrate that CO2 plume migration can be mapped from the seismic, a 4D Seismic feasibility study was carried out using well and fluid data. Gassmann fluid substitution was performed in carbonate reservoir at well, and seismic response of several combination of fluid saturation scenarios on synthetic gathers were analyzed. The CO2 dispersion study, which incorporate integration of subsurface, geomatic and metocean & environment data along with leakage character information, was carried out to understand the potential leakage pathway along existing wells and faults which enable to design a monitoring plan accordingly. The monitoring of wells & reservoir integrity, overburden integrity will be carried out by Fiber Optic System to be installed in injection wells. Significant difference in seismic amplitude observed at the reservoir top during 4D seismic feasibility study for varying CO2 saturation suggests that monitoring of CO2 plume migration from seismic is possible. CO2 plume front with as low as 25% saturation can be discriminated provided seismic data has high signal noise ratio (SNR). 3D DAS-VSP acquisition modeling results show that a subsurface coverage of approximately 3 km2 per well is achievable. Laboratory injectivity studies and three-way coupled modelling simulations established that three injection wells will be required to achieve the target injection rate. As planned injection wells are field centric and storage site area is large, DAS-VSP find limited coverage to monitor the CO2 plume front. Hence, surface seismic acquisition will be an integral component of full field monitoring and time-lapsed evaluations for integrated MMV planning to monitor CO2 plume migration. The integrated MMV planning is designed to ensure that injected CO2 in the reservoir is intact and safely stored for hundreds of years after injection. Field specific MMV technologies for CO2 plume migration with proactive approach were identified after exercising pre-defined screening criteria. © 2021, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,digital storage; gas industry; injection (oil wells); monitoring; offshore gas fields; offshore oil well production; offshore oil wells; petroleum reservoir evaluation; planning; risk assessment; seismic response; site selection; 4d seismic; adaptive approach; feasibility studies; injectivity; integrated monitoring; measurement and verification; monitoring measurements; monitoring plans; plume migration; storage sites; carbon dioxide lasers,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116608770

In this process, the tool wear volume exhibits a strong dependence on the cutting angle (the angle between the fiber orientation and cutting direction). In industrial applications, the perimeters of CFRP workpieces are frequently machined via contour milling. However, it is difficult to avoid cutting angles that cause rapid tool wear in this type of milling. This study proposes a novel rough milling strategy to maintain the cutting angles within a specific range by adjusting the tool feed direction and radial depth of cut to reduce tool wear. In addition, to implement the proposed method for CFRP machining, a software is developed to generate the tool path. The effectiveness of the proposed method for tool life extension during milling of CFRP is experimentally investigated. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korean Society for Precision Engineering.",abrasive wear; bending- induced fiber fracture; composite machining; rough milling; tool path planning,abrasion; fiber; milling (machining); motion planning; bending- induced fiber fracture; carbon-fibre reinforced plastics; composite machining; cutting angles; fiber fracture; plastics machining; rough milling; tool paths planning; tool wear; wear reduction; CFRP,"B.-K.

In particular, load-oriented techniques are of high interest when employing carbon fiber materials, as classical methods, such as tape-laying and laminating, struggle with highly curved and complex geometries and require the costly production of molds. While there have been some promising propositions in this field, most have restricted themselves to a planar slicing approach, which severely limits the ability to place the fibers along stress paths. In this paper, a nonplanar slicing approach is presented that utilizes principal stress directions to construct optimized nonplanar constituting layers on which pathplanning can be carried out. These layers are oriented such that the effect of the weak interlayer adhesion is minimized. Support material is adaptively generated to enable the use of arbitrary part geometry. Furthermore, a continuous pathplanning method and post-processor are applied to yield manufacturing instructions. The approach is verified for its viability of application through experimental investigation on a multi-axis robotic 3D printer. This constitutes an important step in allowing the fabrication of CFRP parts to further utilize the possibilities of additive manufacturing. © 2023 by the authors.",3d printing; additive manufacturing (am); carbon-fiber-reinforced polymers; continuous fiber composites; multi-axis motion; nonplanar slicing; path planning method,additive; CFRP; deposition; fiber; fused deposition modeling; industrial research; 3d printing; 3d printing; CFRP; continuous fiber composites; manufacturing methods; multi-axis motion; nonplanar slicing; part based; path planning method; slicing methods; motion planning,"J.

Topological optimizations were performed with a shear beam and a bending beam to demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. The optimal structure was also determined by a traditional density-based SOMP topology optimization method with an offset path planning method for comparison. The results showed that the printing paths of the optimal structure were consistent with the fiber orientation distribution of the optimal results by the proposed orthogonal-element SOMP method. Correspondingly, the stiffness and the stiffness-to-weight ratio of the optimal specimen by the presented orthogonal-element SOMP method were increased by 30.0% and 26.3%, respectively, compared with those by the traditional SOMP method.

However, CFRPs are hard-to-cut materials due to their anisotropic and laminating characteristics that frequently induce machining damages, such as burrs and interface cracks. During surface milling, the action form at any point on the tool edge on the fiber changes with the rotation of the tool and the cutting tool feeding direction, resulting in varying levels of damage in different machining areas. To ensure the high milling quality of CFRP surfaces, this study established a planning method for cutting tool feed direction for low-damage machining by accounting for the changes in the tool edge and fiber action form during CFRP surface milling. The optimal cutting tool feed direction selection range for low-damage surface milling of CFRP components was determined by calculating the changes in the instantaneous fiber cutting angle and length for different cutting tool feed directions and then analyzing the influence of different cutting tool feed directions on the degree of processing damage of CFRP components. The results indicated that to reduce the burr and interfacial cracking damage in the surface milling of CFRP components, the cutting tool feed direction should be selected from the range 0°–40° relative to the fiber ply direction of the final cutting layer. The results obtained in this study can help determine the cutting tool feed direction for the low-damage surface milling of CFRP components and provide a basis for subsequent research on tool path planning. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",CFRP; cutting tool feed direction; fiber cutting mode; machining damage; surface milling,CFRP; CFRP; film_editing; cutting tools; motion planning; CFRP; cutting mode; cutting tool feed direction; feed direction; fiber cutting mode; fiber cutting mode; low damages; machining damage; polymer components; surface milling; milling (machining),"F.

Theoretical prediction models for the compressive strength of tetrahedral, pyramidal and hexagonal cone structures are developed, with errors within 32.8% compared to experimental results. The effects of strut angle, number and material on the compressive properties and energy absorption capacity of the lattice sandwich structure are analyzed. The pyramidal structure with continuous fibers reinforced 60° struts has the optimum specific compression strength of 10.115MPa/(g/cm3).

When a single step is missed, the lining installation will suffer significantly. Development of a usable quality control standard for material selection, design, installation, and inspection are critical for a successful installation. Work in this area began in the 1980's with studies conducted by the University of California San Diego for the Department of California Transportation (Cal Trans) for the purpose of retrofitting highway bridge columns. The technology moved to the general building industry following the guidelines of ACI 440. During the mid 1990's this technology entered the pipeline industry for the retrofit of Prestressed Concrete Cylinder Pipe (PCCP) with broken wires. Initially, a quality control standard directly related to this application was unavailable. Initial methods drew from the column wrapping methods developed by Cal Trans, ICC and those outlined in ICC (International Code Council) AC 125. However, as this application became more popular both the Fyfe and Fibrwrap Construction companies made large advancements in materials, application, and quality control methods. In the year 2000, the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, MWD, took a serious interest in carbon fiber liners for the retrofit of its 163 miles of PCCP and implemented a testing and review program for CFRP (carbon fiber reinforced polymer). Presented in the paper are the most recent methods developed for the safe and reliable installation of carbon fiber liners.

The process involves multiple human operators manipulating and conforming layers of prepreg to a mold. The manual layup process is ergonomically challenging, tedious, and limits throughput. Moreover, different operators may perform the process differently, and hence introduce inconsistency. We have developed a multi-robot cell to automate the layup process. A human expert provides a sequence to conform to the ply and types of end-effectors to be used as input to the system. The system automatically generates trajectories for the robots that can achieve the specified layup. Using the cell requires the automated generation of different types of plans. This paper addresses two main planning problems: (a) generating plans to grasp and manipulate the ply and (b) generating feasible robot trajectories. We use a hybrid-physics based simulator coupled with a state space search to find grasp plans. The system employs a strategy that applies constraints successively in a non-linear optimization formulation to identify suitable placements of the robots around the mold so that feasible trajectories can be generated. Our system can generate plans in a computationally efficient manner, and it can handle a wide variety of complex parts. We demonstrate the automated layup by conducting physical experiments on an industry-inspired mold using the generated plans. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",automated layup; composite automation; grasp planning; industrial robots; multi-arm manipulation; path-constrained trajectory planning; robot base placement,agricultural robots; CFRP; cast; nonlinear programming; robotics; automaton; trajectory; automated generation; automated planning; computationally efficient; non-linear optimization; physical experiments; planning problem; robot trajectory; state space search; robot programming,"S.K.

The path planning of continuous fiber is closely related to its structural defects and mechanical properties. In this work, continuous fiber reinforced polymer honeycomb structures (CFRPHSs) with different printing paths were designed and fabricated via the fused deposition modeling (FDM) technique. The investigation of fiber dislocation at path corners was utilized to analyze the structural defects of nodes caused by printing paths. The lower stiffness nodes filled with pure polymer due to fiber dislocation result in uneven stiffness distribution. The bending performance and deformation modes of CFRPHSs with different printing paths and corresponding pure polymer honeycomb structures were investigated by three-point bending tests. The results showed that the enhancement effect of continuous fibers on the bending performance of honeycomb structures was significantly affected by the printing paths. The CFRPHSs with a staggered trapezoidal path exhibited the highest specific load capacity (68.33 ± 2.25 N/g) and flexural stiffness (627.70 ± 38.78 N/mm). In addition, the fiber distributions and structural defects caused by the printing paths determine the stiffness distribution of the loading region, thereby affecting the stress distribution and failure modes of CFRPHSs. © 2023 by the authors.",3d printing; bending behaviors; continuous fiber reinforced polymer; honeycomb structures; path planning method; structural defects,3d printing; bending tests; CFRP; defect; fiber; filled polymers; honeycomb structures; stiffness; stress analysis; 3d printing; 3d printing; bending behaviour; continuous fiber reinforced polymer; continuous fibers; fiber-reinforced polymers; fibre reinforced polymers; pure polymers; stiffness distributions; structural defects; motion planning,"Y.

With new applications, one has to consider the specific properties, requirements and the advantages of laser systems to achieve economical results. The time consuming methods that are used today - e.g. program generation by teach-in - lead to a low productivity and low machine utilization, especially with small batches. The two examples given here are focusing on 3D laser processing, e.g. of deep drawn workpieces, and high process flexibility. They are intended to show, how new methods for program generation, simulation and sensor assistance in laser processing can be used to save time in the planning phase and to significantly reduce the expense that is caused by tolerances in shape and position of the parts to process. Experimental investigations have been carried out in the test plant at the iwb, where prototype systems have been realized to demonstrate the concepts. First, there is a flexible Nd: YAG-laser cell which consists of a 1 kW Nd: YAG laser and a 500 W Nd: YAG slab laser, both with fiber optical beam delivery connected to two standard industrial robots. Second, a 5 kW CO2 laser system with a standard six axes industrial robot and external beam delivery system is presented, which is guided by a seam path following sensor. © 1994 SPIE.
